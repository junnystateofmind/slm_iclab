Here\u2019s an analysis of the key points that support this diagnosis:\n\n1. **Emotional Distress**: The patient expresses feelings of being emotionally depleted, stating they feel like they are \"running on empty.\" This sense of exhaustion is a common symptom of depression.\n\n2. **Suicidal Ideation**: The mention of a suicide attempt is a critical indicator of severe emotional distress and is often associated with major depressive disorder. This history raises concern for the patient's safety and mental health.\n\n3. **Loss and Grief**: The recent death of their grandfather adds to an already overwhelming year of loss, including the end of a significant relationship. Grief can exacerbate depressive symptoms, leading to feelings of hopelessness and despair.\n\n4. **Failure and Setbacks**: The patient describes failing their year at university, which can contribute to feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy, both of which are common in depression.\n\n5. **Trauma**: The experiences of physical and sexual assault are significant trauma events that can lead to depression, particularly if they are not processed effectively. Trauma can have a profound impact on mental health, leading to symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\n6. **Emotional Numbness**: The patient mentions feeling \"okay\" but is aware that this may not be an accurate reflection of their emotional state. This self-awareness can indicate a struggle with emotional regulation, which is often seen in depressive disorders.\n\n7. **Overextension for Others**: The patient\u2019s desire to be a \"rock to others\" while neglecting their own needs suggests a lack of self-care, which is common in individuals experiencing depression. This can lead to further emotional exhaustion.\n\n8. **Cognitive Distortions**: The patient expresses concern about lying to themselves and making things worse, indicating possible cognitive distortions, such as negative self-talk or catastrophizing, which are characteristic of depression.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of emotional distress, suicidal ideation, grief, feelings of worthlessness, trauma, and cognitive distortions strongly suggests that the patient may be suffering from depression. It is crucial for the patient to seek professional help to address these symptoms and to develop effective coping strategies.

Phrases like \"I wish more than anything else that I can just disappear and leave this world\" reflect feelings of hopelessness and a desire to escape from reality.\n\n2. **Social Withdrawal**: The writer describes a desire to isolate themselves from others, stating they only want to be alone and have deleted social media to achieve this. This withdrawal from social interactions is a common symptom of depression.\n\n3. **Negative Self-Perception**: The writer expresses self-hatred, stating they hate themselves \"down to the core for the selfish things I have done.\" This negative self-view is often present in individuals with depression.\n\n4. **Cynicism and Pessimism**: The writer exhibits a cynical view of the world, describing humanity as \"riddled with greed and selfishness.\" This pervasive negativity about life and the world around them is often associated with depressive disorders.\n\n5. **Lack of Joy or Interest**: The writer mentions that they do not find the joys of life worth living for and questions the purpose of existence. This anhedonia, or loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyable, is a hallmark symptom of depression.\n\n6. **Existential Questions and Rumination**: The writer engages in deep philosophical questioning about life, war, and morality, which can indicate rumination\u2014a common cognitive pattern in depression where individuals dwell on negative thoughts and feelings.\n\n7. **Desire for Solitude**: The preference for being alone and the enjoyment derived from activities that distract from reality (like studying, reading, and driving) can also signify a retreat into oneself, which is often seen in depressive individuals.\n\nOverall, the combination of hopelessness, social withdrawal, negative self-perception, pervasive cynicism, lack of joy, and rumination strongly suggests that the writer is experiencing depression.

They mention that hobbies and moments that used to provide joy now feel meaningless, which is a hallmark symptom of depression.\n\n2. **Emotional Numbness**: The patient indicates that they feel little to no meaning in their days and can only think of life in terms of weeks, months, and years. This sense of detachment from the present and emotional numbness is often associated with depressive states.\n\n3. **Escapism**: The individual states that they only enjoy activities that provide a complete escape from reality. While escapism can be a common coping mechanism, relying solely on it, especially if those activities are unhealthy, can indicate an underlying struggle with emotional well-being.\n\n4. **Self-Criticism**: The patient expresses feelings of inadequacy, stating that they feel like they are wasting time or not doing activities well enough. This self-critical perspective can be a symptom of depression, where individuals often have negative views of themselves and their capabilities.\n\n5. **Desire for Change**: The individual is seeking advice and expressing a desire to feel engaged and enjoy life again. This recognition of their state and the desire to change is a positive step, but it also highlights their current distress and dissatisfaction with their mental state.\n\nIn summary, the combination of anhedonia, emotional numbness, reliance on escapism, self-criticism, and a desire for improvement suggests that this individual may be experiencing depression.

The anxiety experienced can also exacerbate depressive symptoms.\n\n5. **Isolation**: The writer notes a lack of social support, stating they have no one to talk to and that their friends are preoccupied with their own lives.

This could indicate anhedonia, a common symptom of depression where individuals lose interest in activities they once enjoyed.\n\n2. **Attachment to Past Enjoyments**: The writer mentions only feeling attachment to a few shows from their youth, which might suggest a longing for the past and difficulty finding joy in the present. This could be indicative of a depressive state where one feels disconnected from current experiences.\n\n3. **Awareness of Escapism**: The acknowledgment that engaging in these activities is merely a form of escapism, coupled with the feeling of falling back into the same track, suggests a sense of hopelessness or frustration. This self-awareness can often accompany depressive thoughts, where individuals recognize their coping mechanisms but feel powerless to change their situation.\n\n4. **Perception of Attention Span**: The writer reflects on the notion of having a short attention span, a common concern in the digital age.

The simultaneous feeling of discomfort when hearing their parents fight indicates a struggle between their feelings of resentment and a natural emotional response to conflict in a familial setting. This internal conflict can be a sign of emotional turmoil, which is often present in depression.\n\n2. **Perception of Abuse**: The mention of \"mental abuse\" and \"lack of care\" suggests that the writer has experienced significant emotional pain and neglect throughout their life. Such experiences can contribute to feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and sadness, which are common symptoms of depression.\n\n3. **Discomfort with Conflict**: The writer's discomfort in witnessing parental conflict, despite their expressed hatred, could indicate a sense of helplessness or a desire for harmony, which may not align with their feelings of anger. This ambivalence can lead to feelings of sadness or depression, as the individual may feel trapped in a situation where they cannot escape emotional pain.\n\n4. **Cognitive Dissonance**: The cognitive dissonance of feeling both hatred and discomfort suggests a struggle with their emotional state. This can lead to rumination, a common feature of depression, where the individual becomes preoccupied with negative thoughts and feelings about themselves and their situation.\n\n5. **Lack of Agency**: The inability to change the dynamics of the family situation, combined with the emotional pain of witnessing conflict, may lead to feelings of powerlessness, which is often associated with depression.\n\nIn conclusion, while the post does not provide a full clinical picture or a definitive diagnosis, the combination of emotional conflict, feelings of abuse, discomfort with familial conflict, cognitive dissonance, and a sense of powerlessness suggests that the writer may be experiencing symptoms consistent with depression.
