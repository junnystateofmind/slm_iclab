My closest friend had a heart to heart with me about it and even though it still hurts losing the only place I felt I could relax and enjoy myself I was starting to let it go now that I knew I didn't have to worry about coming back.

She wont talk to me about it whatever it is and I know its bad cause she isn't acting like herself. Part of me is afraid it has to do with me but isn't my fault. I talked with a close friend and I was able to regain some of my reasoning to eventually tell her that until she wants to talk with me I'll leave her be and give her space to think. But it's still a bit disheartening that she doesn't say I love you back...its been 2 insistence and the second time she just said \"You Too\" so maybe she's just distracted by her thoughts and forgot.   \n\n\nThis year has been the saddest year of all for me, I wont say depressing cause I haven't been diagnosed, and I'm just hoping these feelings go away cause I'm not myself and that annoys me to no end.

I can\u2019t do even basic stuff, like I need to motivate myself to take a shower or find reasons to eat something. I\u2019m finally taking some medication. I still struggle with finding a job, but it\u2019s okay I guess, kinda regret wasting all my money and not saving more. That\u2019s like a coping mechanism. I starve myself and then feel sick again. I can\u2019t motivate myself to workout because I don\u2019t have any limits and I either don\u2019t do anything or workout till I\u2019m exhausted. I either cry a lot because of everything or feel nothing at all. I have like two friends now and my boyfriend. I appreciate them the most. But I really hate myself for not being able to have phone calls with my boyfriend(we\u2019re in a long distance rn). I really love him and I want to change it but I can\u2019t make myself do that?? Like he knows about my issues and he\u2019s very patient and supportive but I have a feeling like I\u2019m bothering him al the tome and making him feel sad because calling someone you love is like the very basic thing that can make you feel closer to each other. But that\u2019s not the point of my post, I have no idea if it even makes sense. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m so tired, I\u2019m not feeling broken, I\u2019m not having desire to end my life because I know that it\u2019s just temporary and I\u2019ll be fine. But I\u2019m feeling extremely not motivated at all, I\u2019m sad and I hate myself for not being productive. I\u2019m afraid to lose my boyfriend or my friends and I hate being that annoying person who always asks \u201cyou don\u2019t regret our relationship\u201d. I\u2019m tired and I have no idea what to do. I\u2019ve been feeling so sad lately and very stressed and I can\u2019t sleep and I have headaches all the time.

I\u2019ve been debating posting on here for a while but I\u2019m having more suicidal thoughts than ever before and I just need to get this all of my chest. I\u2019m 32, male. I have an amazing girlfriend who is way out of my league and a fun job I enjoy and yet, here I am. \n\nDespite having some really good parts of my life, I\u2019m slammed by thoughts of being worthless and just living a pointless existence. I\u2019m in debt up to my eyeballs and my credit is trashed. I feel like despite getting a $15,000 raise at work, I\u2019m still nowhere near where I want to be at this point in my life. I feel like I have no tangible future and am just waiting to die one day. In the past 4 years I\u2019ve lost my father and my grandmother, two of the most influential people in my life. I\u2019m in the process of moving but am having a difficult time finding good apartments because of my credit so Ive been forced to stay with my mom until I\u2019m settled. I travel for my job and my car is falling apart but I don\u2019t have good replacement options again because of the credit issue. I\u2019m ridden with anxiety about everything and fear of future issues prevents me from enjoying the now. To top it all off, I was visiting my girlfriend this weekend who lives a few hours away from me and I severely inured my knee and I can\u2019t walk. I have to find a surgeon and probably have an operation and she wants to take care of me hand and foot but it just makes me feel like I\u2019m a giant burden. She\u2019s so amazing and I feel like I don\u2019t offer anything financially and am just a 32 dependent who, as of right now can barely make it to the bathroom because of this damn leg. \n\nI am an atheist. I don\u2019t believe in any form of an afterlife as I just can\u2019t accept something with no evidence. I firmly believe in my heart that my grandmother and father are gone. Aside from their graves nothing remains of them and they are not in another realm enjoying themselves. All that exists for then is the black void of nothingness. And despite so many rays of sunshine in my dark life, I feel so envious of them. To not have to feel this anxiety and pain anymore is such an appealing feeling to me. This world is such a terrible place where ignorance and hate have run so rampant and people take such joy in hurting their fellow man. What future can society have with a foundation like this? I find myself thinking about ending everything on a near daily basis. I see lots of redditors posting here about how they are excited for some kind of afterlife because they can\u2019t accept that this is the best we can do. But for me, an absence of anything would be as good as the existence of a heaven. \n\nI feel better having laid all this out in text but I still find myself objectively weighing the pros and cons of ending my life. So I don\u2019t know what I was hoping for by posting this. Maybe I need someone to talk me off the ledge... who knows. But in all honestly, leaping from the ledge looks better and bettter with each passing minute...\nAs a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

My father abandoned our family when I was 14. He was my best friend at the time... I haven't seen him in 6 years. This void made me become extremely close to my few friends. My clinginess reached a point where they got fed up from me and my anxiety and paranoia, that I've now lost my closest friends. I used to reach out to them for help, but it reached a point where everything was on their shoulders and they couldn't handle it anymore, so they distanced themselves with time.  \nI used to be more fit and more attractive, but my life has taken a downwards spiral. I've gained about 70 lbs and my self-consciousness eats me up on the inside. My anxiety is through the roof and I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I'm on anxiety meds but truly think I should be on anti-depressants. I am now failing out of school and I don't have the heart to tell my mother. It will break her, but also I know that once she finds out, my life will probably turn into more of a hell, as she's always had extremely high standards for me. \n\nI'm still a virgin. I've never had a girlfriend. I was seeing this girl when I was 17, but that was about it. And that was at my peak attractiveness. It is now laughable how unattractive I am. People will literally laugh at me because of my appearance. My self-confidence is inexistent. I get anxiety attacks when people just look at me because I think that they are judging me on how I look. I can't deal with this anymore.\n\nI moved away from my hometown 3 years ago for university. I haven't made a single new friend. I live alone. I literally don't use my voice anymore because I have no one to talk to. It reaches the point where I talk to myself because I'm scared that if I go without talking for so long that I will lose my voice. The only time I used to use my voice was while playing video-games online, it was the only thing that brought me a bit of joy. But my console broke, and I can't afford to fix it.\n\nI have no ambitions. I don't know what I want to do in life. Everyone around me seems to have it figured out. Meanwhile, I'm a loser that is eating his life away. The only future I envision having is honestly the one where I throw myself off of my apartment building. I think about just ending it all the time. \n\nI feel alone in this world, and I don't have the motivation nor the self-confidence to do anything about it. The only people that may care about me are the couple family members I have, but I have put them under so much shit for all of the stuff I've done in the past that they are fed up with me.

At the time bullying got worse and I made a few acquaintances but no real close friends. When I was 17 I dropped out of school and moved out of my family home. I started to have panic attacks in the shower and that was when I turned to drugs to numb the pain. Xanax was my go to for sedation as I could fight the effects somehow I loved that. Iv been a daily cannabis smoker for most of the time since I was 16 except the times I ran out and couldn't get anymore.

I was taken to a hospital, and a neurologist saw me and said I had no signs of any problems whatsoever but to make sure he prescribed me declofenac and to get a resonance on my head. \n\nNo tumors where found and the declofenac made my problems worsen, I went to a different hospital where my grandmother sister works as head of emergency and pediatrician. The doctor who attended me stated I was fine and had nothing, I studied for a nursing license and knew the look in the doctors face when I told her I'm still in pain after administrating medication was of \"she just wants drugs\" face. I told my grandmas sister and she told me, that the doctor who attended me they always fight because of her attitude and insinuation on patients. At this time I was already 2 months in pain, my family tried to look for other know neurologist in the field to see what's going on and none of them knew.\n\n3 months I was talking to a friend and just for a moment I felt numb, numb as in I didn't feel any pain. My dad got scared and saw my left eye drift away, he took me to a oftalmologist. He didn't know what's going on when he checked me so he referred me to a hospital specialized in neuro-oftalmologist. I went through the emergency room and I was obviously angry frustrated you name it. The doctor checked my eyes and told me I had papilledema, and it might be cause by the birth control pills since I was always having issues with my hormones. The blood pressured my eyes thus having nausea, headaches, desoroentation, sensitivity to light, and insomnia.\n\nI was treated for papilledema and I can't use any birth control whatsoever, but now I'm still sensitive to light and I see like those huge TVs in the 90s and VHS. Because my left eye was left with nerve damage, I can't see my peripheral view from both my eyes. the left eye its been losing the blur I see and it's getting darker, as in pitch black and have like a 1cm of blurred or I think even less. I'm also not being able to see most colors or differentiate in deepness (as in stairs, steps, holes etc) \n\nIt's been 6 months now..\n\nI changed doctors, learned myself to go through my surroundings without depending in my eye sight. I no longer have papilledema and I still get headaches even when I try to force my eye sigth, plus In December we found out my knees is more above than usual and that's why it pops out. But that time it popped out it didn't went in and now I have to use kinesiology tape to have support and control over it.\n\nI've been snapping at a lot of people degrading me, telling me it's nothing, people are in worse situations be grateful.\n\nBut I'm not allowed to snap, I'm not allowed to defend myself, I'm not allowed to call people out when they make me feel like I've literally gone through nothing.\n\nI have no friends, and the people I know don't know my position. Because they literally don't give a sh*T\n\nIm social whenever I can and this was my actual fear losing my eye sight. I'm not afraid of risking it, making hard decisions, animals, crisis. My fear is actually coming true..\n\nHow am I not going to feel depressed, sad, upset, angry, frustrated....\n\nHOW?!

I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. \n\nI spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.\n\nI have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world.

My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.\n\nI feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. \n\nI applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. \n\nI spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars then needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. \n\nTwo years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. \n\nSpent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.\n\nI got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later..\n\nI just literally can't take anymore of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. \n\nI also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. \n\nI have looked up issues with autism and self diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum. I am just so tired of fighting and so tired of going through life like this barely being able to breath and barely being able to survive and have absolutely nothing to show for it.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

Apologies in advance this is going to be all over the place, im on mobile and im lost. Not real names, this is a throw away etc etc etc.\nOkay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.\nI was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a \"happy\" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to \"protect\" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted \"who I was\" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming \"DONT TOUCH ME GERM\" \"GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF\" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) \"You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak\". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me \"mysteriouslyreddited\". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell \"get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!\". I replied with \"well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are\" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and \"ignored\" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I'm not looking for help I just need to talk to someone. I am doing okay I just had so much pent up I needed a release. Next therapy session will hopefully straighten up my current state of mind\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

Im feeling so low right now, been crying all night, and I just want to get better, but nothing seems to work. During Christmas vacation, I realised my partner had been cheating on me, the night I founded out, he went to that girl house and had intercourse with her. He still came back to my place after and told me everything the next day. I completely lost it, It was the first time someone cheated on me. I felt betrayed, and couldnt wrap my head around it. My reaction was to drink as much alcool, smoke cigarette until I could forget what happen.. unfortunately that wasnt enough I was still feeling so much pain. I than decides to take a half empty bottle of xanax with a bottle of antidepressant. Just to wash the pain away, just like that I was doing my first suicide attempt.  20 minutes after I realised what I had done and called emergency, an ambulance came over and I spent 24 hours at psychiatry aisle. I started seeing a psychiatrist after that, and was diagnosed for borderline personality. For me it makes sense, but it seems close friend and family think its too much, that Im not borderline.. thing is Im really good at hiding my true self. Ive been boulimic for years without anyone ever knew I was. Ive been having intense rage and impulsive reaction when Im in love. \n\nAnyway.. lets come back to my story, I ended up staying with my partner, a decision that has been torturing me ever since.

I made really good friends in this city tho, even if i wasn't going to school anymore  at one point i was still very happy because of them.\n\nSo i told my parents i wanted to stop engineering school, that i wanted to get a job until next year when i will go study something i always dreamt about, becoming a doctor. I went back home for holidays, 3 weeks ago.\n\nI have rough background story with my parents, i'm always in conflict with them and until last summer they always solved conflicts by hitting me or insulting me, saying horrible things that made me hate them. They did make me sleep outside for a few days when i was still a good student in preparatory class, they made me bleed several times, my dad with a sharped stick of wood and my mom with her nails.\n\nI told them i wanted to get a job in the city i was studying, far from home, because i could be near my friends. I told them being home with them was torture, that it was making me go insane and suicidal. I'm still at their home rn, i have a job, but i still want to go live in this city, with my friends and my girlfriend who lives there and to get a job there. Nobody talks to me at home, they took my computer and my credit card. I cant go out, i cant see any friend nearby, i cant do anything or enjoy life. \n\nThey want me stay here, no discussion possible. They make me want to kill myself, they repeating every time i talk about my friends that they don't care about me, that they think i'm a looser and  a piece of shit because i stopped this school.\n\nI want to go to this city next week, but i dont have my appartment anymore.

Never really wrote about myself online but I\u2019m very curious and the stigma behind death seems to discourage discussion of it. I\u2019ve actively tried talking to my family and a therapist about my perception of my life but their inability to understand that it does not and never has stemmed from depression irritates me. \n\nI want to die. I believe that death is the ultimate end goal for every single human being and rapidly increasing its approach would lead me to the end. Please note, I have a social life. I have close friends at college and at work. I also have a pretty active socia life (I go to a couple parties here and there). I\u2019m in a solid relationship (been together for two years now), and I do not abuse drugs or alcohol, only at kick backs or something. I do not have depression, I\u2019m pretty laid back down to earth guy who has never had any mental illness nor any thoughts of worthlessness, extreme sadness etc. \n\nPersonally, the meaningless within life is the main motivator for my methodology. Realistically, the now is true living (due to its value, the past you can\u2019t change and the future is unknown). Past the now, life is to be, not happening. Work, sex, love, entertainment, etc. are used to keep individuals living but what for? We work a 9-5 job, we have kids, we do all of these things and yet the reasoning boils down to survival and entertainment. entertainment to keep us looped within an endless cycle of netflix shows or games or tv shows or youtube and survival of work to eat and feed the future generation. realistically, love is a chemical compound effect which sparks to motivate the production of kids. to continue the species. the love of a parent to a child is to prevent child hood death so the child can become a parent and produce more children for the cycle to continue. when you really boil down what life is it\u2019s just an endless cycle of continuation within a species. \n\nIdk i\u2019m just curious if anyone else feels this way. You develop your own meaning in life but that meaning isn\u2019t even yours. You are taught that meaning through society and social interactions. Your parents develop that meaning for you and you believe it\u2019s yours but in reality it isn\u2019t. The pursuit of a good job or a big house or to produce music or to be a serial killer all of these perceptions you learn from society in which you incorporate into your definition of life. how you want to live isn\u2019t even your own perception it\u2019s just a jumble of social expectations mixed into you.\n\nIf anyone can help me understand this it\u2019d be a great help. I just want to know why life has meaning and why we live if not for social pressures, a biological barrier which prevents self harm, your \u201cpersonal\u201d meaning, etc.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

I, as well as most people on the subreddit, have depression. I've been struggling with it for a few years. Recently I was prescribed with welbutrin. I must say that I cant express how much better I've been doing. I still have my moments at night but it's definitely not as bad. I've been struggling with my weight for a while as well but I was just laying in bed and had a weird switch get flipped and now I want to change my diet, i want to start going to the gym and be active. It's crazy because I'm lazy as fuck. Maybe doing this will help a lot with my depression. \n\nI'm scared though because a few years ago I broke my back while playing football. I was really active outdoors. I played football for the school, I kayaked, hiked, etc. Not being able to do those things has caused me to gain a bunch if weight and become insanely depressed. I lost feeling in my toes for 6 months after the initial accident. I wasn't able to do anything active. My toes are fine now but the fact that I'm not able to do what I used to do because of the accident has caused me to be depressed. I dont want to be depressed anymore, I'm sure everyone can relate. I want to get my life back the way it was and the only way I can do it is to step out of my comfort zone and find someone who will be willing to help me achieve my goal. \n\nAlthough it may be difficult, I know if I try my hardest I can achieve my goal. I apologize for the rant but this sudden change in my mindset has got me really motivated and honestly a bit emotional. I was scared I'd never find a way out of this rut. I'm also scared to lose this motivation. I dont want this to be a small fluke of motivation and then tomorrow I'm right back at where I was. But I shouldn't focus on tomorrow. \n\n\nAnyways again sorry for the rant but I couldn't bottle it up.

On the weekends I'll either just sit in my room all day watching YouTube or nap all day because I can't even find the energy to get out of bed and do anything. I can't even find the will to finish my overwhelming amounts of homework. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I don't have any skills, talents, or interests, and I can't even get a job since I live in the middle of nowhere and I'm terrified of learning to drive. I don't even really know anything about the real world. I'm just a husk of a person who rots in isolation in my room all day fantasizing about dying. I am so desperately alone and I feel like a absolute worthless moron. My entire life I've never even had one friend to talk or confide in. Every time in the past when I was going to public school and tried to make friends with people I always fucked up and made myself look idiotic because I never understood how to talk to people and form connections with them. I can't even make online friends. No one cares about me, not even my own parents. Every time I try to have a conversation with my mom, (who is the only thing keeping me from not being totally socially isolated as I am pathetically desperate just to have someone talk to me since I have no one else) she doesn't even bother to pretend to listen to me. She has more important things to do than spare a moment of her time talking to me. I get it, but I wish she didn't make it so obvious. \n\nI just am so tired of trying to survive each day of hell by myself.

I'm scared of fucking my life up even more than I already have. Maybe it'd be easier at this point for me to just drown myself to prevent having a depressing future where I'm suffering even more.

Managed to get fucking C\u2019s all throughout though so I got no scholarship for college. \n\nAfter high school my parents were amazing enough to pay for my college. 5000 fucking dollars a semester for me to do average my first semester then fail calculus my second semester. After my second semester I let my father convince me that I should go to school closer to home and do electrical engineering. First semester I did average. Next semester I failed fucking Chemistry and lab. Semester after that I failed my chemistry lab again so I had to switch to Computer engineering. Semester after that I failed Pde\u2019s. Pretty much every semester after that I\u2019ve failed classes. Not because I\u2019m not learning the material but because I\u2019m so fucking lazy I don\u2019t do half the homework. Usually my homework grades suck but my test scores are good but not good enough to keep me from failing. Every year my parents keep telling me that they are going to make me move out and pay for my own school, but they keep giving me more chances and I keep royal fucking those chances. Honestly don\u2019t understand why they give me so many chances. \n\nAnyways, this year isn\u2019t any different. Last semester I took 3 fucking classes (9 credit hours) and failed all three of my classes. Worst I\u2019ve ever done. So this current semester I\u2019m retaking 2 of the 3 I failed and just had to withdraw from one of them and the other I will probably get a C in. I don\u2019t get it. I have a part time job at fucking Chili\u2019s, I live at home, have everything going for me; don\u2019t have to worry about expenses, amazing girlfriend, family that loves me. Yet I can\u2019t fucking pass two fucking classes.\n\nI\u2019m a failure. Honestly no other explanation. I get to tell my mother that after this semester I am dropping out and moving out, therefore waisting 50,000$ of her money. Thing is, if I can\u2019t pass two fucking classes how the fuck an I suppose to live on my own. Other thing is, I wouldn\u2019t be on my own, my girlfriend would be with me which makes everything worse because I would be dragging her down with me. So instead of moving out I have decided I should probably just kill myself. I\u2019ve planned it out for the most part. I have a 30-06 in my room that guarantees my death, I\u2019ve scouted a place out where no one will be able to find my corpse. I haven\u2019t written my goodbye letter because I\u2019m honestly too pathetic to write one and probably won\u2019t even leave one, I plan on depositing all of my money into an account that my girlfriend has access to so she can get out of this house as quickly as possible if need be, etc...\n\nI know my death will negatively impact those closest too me but I\u2019m almost positive my parents will get over it. Honestly my father has given up on me so I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll care much. My grandparents will be devastated but they will get over it.\nOnly one I\u2019m worried about is my girlfriend. She\u2019s about to start a new job right when I plan on killing myself and I don\u2019t want to ruin that. I\u2019m sure I can figure something out.\n\nAt the same time. I really don\u2019t want to die. It still breaks my heart that I have to leave everything behind. My family has two amazing dogs that I would die for, I managed to go out with a girl way out of my league for 5 years that\u2019s about to get a job relevant to her dream career, I have grandparents, aunts, and uncles that all seem to like me, etc...\n\nGuess I\u2019ll just bring a couple bottles to try and get over that heartbreak so I can pull the trigger.\n\nAnyways, sorry to start my own fucking pity party. It was just hurting me to not say or write anything before I die since I\u2019ve done relatively good at hiding my depression from everyone. \n\nThank you for reading.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

Throughout our relationship he was often depressed, angry at everything, narcissistic, extremely anxious, would go through phases of not eating, etc. I tried helping as much as I could and encouraging he get help (which he did a few times, on and off seeing a therapist) but it never worked.\n\nI had to cut off our relationship because it just became \"too much\". He would blame me for his carelessness, would get annoyed if I offered help in any way, and was just constantly negative. I just often didn't feel loved, and without ranting his mental health issues were stressful as I tried and tried to help him and it felt useless.\n\nWhen we broke up I didn't feel the need to block him but did not want to be \"friends\" or really ever have any communication any more. Since we broke up, he has texted me here and there that he's suicidal, hates everyone, screams at himself, has no reason to live, etc. He told me that since I broke up with him he would kill himself, but i took that more so as manipulation. I would text him trying to help, offering advice, and so on, which was mentally draining because any time I'd try and help he'd continue texting things like \"I'm just gonna kill myself\". I have told him so many times he needs professional help and by doing so will improve his mental health. \n\nHe's nearly 30 and has barely held a job because he \"hates all the managers\" wherever he works and continuously drops out of school to sit at home and be handed money by his mom and play PS4 all day. When I encourage finding a different job or so on he gets offended and tells me I'm a \"slave\" because I have a full time job.\n\nI've since entered a new relationship with someone I love very much. When my ex randomly occasionally texts me (he texts me probably once every 10-15 days) saying he wants to kill himself I panic and reply and try to help. I told my current bf about helping my ex and he was understandably upset. I know I need to stop communication with my ex but I worry by telling him we need to stop talking he actually will kill himself. I have told a close friend this and they told me if he doesn't want to accept help or seek any help, and kills himself, at least I tried and there was nothing more I could do. \n\nThe other day at work I checked my phone and had a ton of missed texts from him saying he was going to kill himself  &amp; that he has no reason to live anymore. All the texts made me panic terribly, I had to leave work because I started crying and ended up calling suicide prevention (they were beyond unhelpful) because I know he needs help. After 4 years of hearing him talk about being depressed, and never accepting help and then breaking up and still hearing it through text and STILL trying to get him to see a professional and get help I am honestly burned out and mentally drained. I don't know what else I can do at this point besides telling him, for the last time, he needs help and due to me being in a new relationship we need to stop talking and I wish him the best.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

It seems like the only time I'm happy is when I'm in a relationship, but needing to constantly use a girl as a crutch to justify my existence isn't much better than being miserable by myself. I don't even enjoy life anymore I'm just going through the motions because I have to.\n\nI don't know what to do and it frustrates me. I'm by no means suicidal but I'm tired of feeling tired. Every morning I wake up after 3 or 4 hours of sleep and lay there doing nothing. I feel useless and undesirable, I go on tinder and maybe I'll have a match or two but they just bore me with their monotonous bios and questions. It's not like I'm on there being toxic I do my best to make conversation but the thoughtless, close ended responses these girls send me annoy me and I just drop them.\n\nI just want to feel content but I'm not even sure if I remember how. I know I'm not the only one who's ever felt this way. what did you guys/girls do to fill this hole I guess.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

I don't know why I'm posting like it's going to do anything for me but whatever. This is gonna be pretty wordy. A fella out here fighting the long fight. Everything's shit. Everything's been shit since I was like 11. There hasn't been a day in at least 5-6 years that suicide hasn't crossed my mind. I've managed to stay pretty functional. Less so now. I can't do anything. I'm used to having bad days. I'm used to that. But for the longest time my bad days were maximum 17 hours in bed then I get up to piss or something. It's different now. My bad days are 31 hours in bed no food or water. I don't go online, I don't talk to anyone, I just sulk. Everything's gone to shit. \n\nMy family is big against any sort of therapy/mental illness sort of talk. I was too. Last year in August I broke down and started therapy because I knew I was slacking. I decided If not to change my mood, then to at least change my behavior. It helped for a while. Cut to December. I'm off my shit. I break down again and resort to meds. I've always been against meds for myself so idk maybe that adds some perspective. I felt like meds were the equivalent of me giving up my personality, becoming the masses. Pretentious I know but whatever. Meds don't do shit. I've had so many appointments with my psychiatrist to change my meds or the dosage but nothing has worked and it's been too long. \n\nI decided to go into an outpatient program in February. Things were really bad. I started disassociating very intensely. I can't feel my body move, I can't control my motions. It's one of the most terrifying things I've ever experienced. I went through the application process and got accepted into outpatient care. I was finally going to get thorough help. Confidentiality had been broken, relationships irreparable but I was going to do what I needed to do. The day I start I find out my insurance doesn't cover it.\n\nI am so fucking tired of being too poor. I'm tired. It's so fucking humiliating to not be able to take care of yourself because you can't afford it. When I grew up everyone thought I was gonna be the kid to escape this shit. To break the cycle and actually make something of myself and be content. I was smart, I was bilingual and inventive and passionate and I learned about how to best fight my circumstances. I really thought I had a chance. But I don't.\n\nThere's no escaping the cycle of poverty. It comes back to bite no matter what you do.  My grades suffered because I didn't have a computer, or internet, or because I was losing my apartment or whatever the crisis might've been at the time. My grades are shit now, like a 1. something gpa. I can't get a scholarship and to be totally fucking honest I'm not sure I'd even graduate high school. I'm a financial drain on all my guardians. My mom won't buy me food, my dad is trying to not lose his other kid, and my grandma (who raised me) is forced to live with my dad and pay off the house because he can't afford it and knew he could leech off of her. I can't work because I'm already failing all my classes and I'm supposed to fix that.\n\nThe worst part is being aware of my situation. I can't afford to be healthy. I can't afford to be educated. I can't afford to be happy. How fucked up is that? I don't try and paint myself as the victim of this dumb ass capitalist society but come ON. It doesn't matter how I play the game. It doesn't matter how hard I try and be better. I can't pay for it. If I keep going, then in 10 years I'm gonna be a deadbeat working three jobs in some toxic relationship just like every other adult in my life. \n\nI can't have a life. I can't pay for it. If I kill myself that's like max a $7000 funeral. I have about a thousand and my family probably wouldn't spend that much anyway. Hell, if I can get rid of the body they won't even have to deal with that. No more food expenses, no more school expenses, no more health expenses. They can sell my shit, rent out my room, i don't care: I'll be fucking dead what do I need all this shit for? I can't keep up. Every time I turn a corner there's some new crisis to be dealt with.

I'm not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. Maybe I'll get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone.\n\nI\u2019ve started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. This is yet another attempt, let\u2019s see what happens.\n\nI\u2019m a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.\n\nI first realized my teen angst wasn\u2019t just a \u201cphase\u201d sometime in my early 20\u2019s. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I\u2019ve since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that \u201cpoetry\u201d in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn\u2019t anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.\n\nI was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone\u2019s house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn\u2019t much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.\n\nWhen I arrived in Canada I didn\u2019t speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had \u201ccarpet time\u201d (when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn\u2019t say anything, partly because I couldn\u2019t physically, partly because I couldn\u2019t mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren\u2019t close.)\n\nThis childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn\u2019t fit in with the \u201ccool popular kids.\u201d Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let\u2019s call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.\n\nEnding of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an \u201cin\u201d with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started \u201crelationships\u201d with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let\u2019s call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent\u2019s cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn\u2019t know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can\u2019t remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun \u201cfashion\u201d night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. \n\nFinally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she\u2019s a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. \n\nI first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I\u2019m not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn\u2019t matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn\u2019t want to, or couldn\u2019t break.\n\nI got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer even if I didn\u2019t really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven\u2019t done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn\u2019t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven\u2019t seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. \n\nThe truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor\u2019s heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I\u2019ve ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. \n\nAbout a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn\u2019t right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I\u2019m not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.\n\nI was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn\u2019t know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can\u2019t say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I\u2019m moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got \u201cback together\u201d, continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn\u2019t mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. \n\nWe dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn\u2019t want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren\u2019t the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. \n\nI laughed at this. I didn\u2019t cry, I didn\u2019t feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.\n\nIt took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren\u2019t right for each other.\n\nSo this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn\u2019t satisfy me anymore and my body can\u2019t handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can\u2019t afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can\u2019t stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. \n\nThe job thing - realized I\u2019m the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn\u2019t an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can\u2019t stay excited and motivated. \n\nLast night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn\u2019t find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn\u2019t show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don\u2019t know if I want to stop. I\u2019ve had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I\u2019ve cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I\u2019m not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don\u2019t have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I\u2019m finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. \n\nI would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word \u201cI\u201d is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won\u2019t lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn\u2019t felt the pull of it.\n\nThank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it. I am very scared and for some reason the only thing I thought of this morning was writing this.\nAs a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

I've slept on the floor for four years without even changing my sheets or blankets. I haven't had laundry detergent in four years. I wash my underwear in the bathtub. The heater has been messed up all winter so I've been freezing. I have one blanket and one sheet. No pillows after they got infested with bed bugs.   \n\n\nAll I've eaten for the past three years are potatoes, macaroni and cheese and balogne sandwiches. I haven't been able to even leave the house in 3 years and the last time was for my moms funeral. I can't even shave my face or legs because I haven't had razers, shaving cream or anything in three years. I haven't had face wash. I've had the same bottle of shampoo for three years. I've had four bars of soap for the past three years... My kitchen sink doesn't work, I wash my one plastic bowl in the bathroom sink.  I don't speak to anyone. I'm essentially already dead. Although I doubt I get 2000 calories a day, the type of foods I've eat have made me gain at least 30 pounds and so none of my clothes fit me. I have one pair of stretchy pajama pants and two tshirts that fit me.  It could be worse, i could be homeless so I've kept this inside for this long but I'm tired. My life is really already over. I'm exhausted. After this month, I won't have internet and I am fairly certain with nothing to do at all, no music etc, I will go insane. So I've made peace with my fate and I guess this is the last month of my life. I don't remember what happiness is. I can't even think of anything that could change my life at this point. There isn't even a dream. There just isn't a point to go on at this point.    \n\n\nI feel like a failure. I feel sad and hurt. I found one of my mom's journals recently, she mentions she was raped by her father when she was a kid. So that is the energy surrounding me.

She was 13 when we met so she started kindergarten early and skipped a grade. then there's me who's two years older but nothing compared to her. She gets straight A's, takes all AP and honors classes, made VARSITY softball as a freshman (age of a 7th grader), got the lead roles in all the theatre shows, and just has a perfect life. \n\nThen there's me who doesn't have the best home life. I've tried telling her I can't sleep over because I need my meds and for other reasons. But then she just tells me \"oh everyone feels sad sometimes. You don't need those stupid pills.\" Or if I tell her that it's my anxiety and ADHD pills she is like \"everyone has some form of ADHD. Have you seen everyone who can't pay attention? Those pills don't do anything\"\n\nI'm very reluctant to end our friendship because I don't have any other friends. Also my Mom has gotten really close with their family and I can't end the friendship beacuse that would be awkward. I feel like this is toxic though. Idk maybe it's just cause I'm not good enough I feel like shit.\nAs a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question. Does this person suffer from suicidal potential or depression? '.

I\u2019m not feeling too well right now. I\u2019m getting these thoughts and suicidal feeling again. They come back occasionally. Right now, I\u2019m eating with my beautiful mother, laughing with my dad as he says my mother is a wonderful cook. I broke down last night when I finished reviewing and studying from my classes. I studied hard for a test I had today, and I felt good about it! Right now, I\u2019m eating as I type this. This day? I thought it would be bad, but it was okay, turning to bad. I\u2019m In a relationship. I love this boy so much. I\u2019ve been happiest with him since years ago. Im a sophomore in high school by the way. I\u2019ve trusted my boyfriend so much and he\u2019s always been there for me. Today however, I felt something was wrong. He didn\u2019t really speak with me. But it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m probably just overthinking it, I want nothing but pure happiness for him. Whether he finds it with someone else or me. I\u2019ve always helped others, always had a smile on my face and I\u2019ve always wanted nothing but happiness for everyone. I\u2019ve only want happiness for everyone else. I want them to feel good and appreciated by atleast someone when they do something. I\u2019ve always supported through anything and I\u2019ve never judged. I\u2019ve been kind to everyone. I appreciate everything that\u2019s given to me, but it\u2019s been a few months I\u2019ve been feeling these usual suicide thoughts. They come often. It\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been like this, trying to hang on and move on from it. Whether I see happy moments, times where I love this view. Or others where I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m feeling.\n\nI felt pressured by my mother. Verbally. I hate trying so hard at school, and failing. What\u2019s the point? I\u2019m going to fail anyways. I\u2019ve always done my best in everything and I\u2019ve always tried to stay happy and look the positive way. But I can\u2019t anymore. I\u2019ve always thought, what if I can just end it? Would anyone really miss me? I think about it, imagining my parents. But, would I really make a difference? Will I go to hell? Religiously talking, I love god. But I\u2019m sorry, I feel like I\u2019ve lost faith in myself. I don\u2019t see it anymore. And every night, I pray, to have a good day, to see my parents, my friends. To stay safe. I want to die, but I don\u2019t. But I want to attempt, but I\u2019m afraid. What if I fail? Would my family be ashamed? \n\nI think about it daily, and I feel like the only reason I\u2019m\nhere is for my love. To be there for him when he needs company, to be there for him when he can\u2019t find the light, to be with him when he can\u2019t be happy. To support him through the good and bad. No matter what, no matter the past. For my dad, who\u2019s worked really hard every single night for me and my family. For my friend, who needs support from his friends and family. For my dog, who always listened to me when I felt alone, knowing he wouldn\u2019t understand, but knows I\u2019m upset and let\u2019s me cry on him when I don\u2019t have anyone else.  \n\nI don\u2019t know, I feel like tonight could be it.

Don't get me wrong, we both have our faults, but we always do our best to understand each other and walk through hard times with one another. However,  the last two times that I have been very depressed, she ended up pushing me away when I needed her the most. About a month ago she got very upset with me that she walked over to me and angrily accused me of not showing enough attention to our relationship. I had a family member pass just a few weeks before, and I think it was finally getting to me. I apologized, told her that I'm depressed, saying that I wish I could be doing better. I told her that I was depressed and she walked away, angry, slamming the door behind her. The person that I love the most turned her back on me when I needed her the most. I went for a walk, we messaged each other, and she asked me to come back. She was crying so much, I felt bad. She felt terrible for not listening to me. This wasn't the first time that something like this has happened though. When I am depressed, she pushes me away. Besides this, my girlfriend is incredibly loving, thoughtful, creative in our relationship, and sacrifices so much for us.

I used to text those crisis hotlines, but they never help anymore. They\u2019re all trained to recite the same things, and it\u2019s aggravating having the same conversation over and over again where it doesn\u2019t really feel like my feelings are really being validated. \n\nEveryone goes through things. I know that as much as the next person. The world is a cruel yet charming place filled with a mixture of amazing people and people who couldn\u2019t give two shits about others. I hate how complicated the world is, and I hate how the good things people do never seems to lessen the bad things. I have turned into such a cynical person and as time goes on I\u2019ve found it harder and harder to see good in the world past some amazing friends and the unconditional love that animals provide. After someone killed my beloved dog though, everything just feels bleak again. He didn\u2019t deserve the death he got, and it angers me that nobody even wants to put in the time to find out who would have done this to my best friend. \u201cIt won\u2019t bring him back\u201d, you\u2019re right. It won\u2019t, but maybe it would settle this raging anger I have inside? Maybe it would help me feel less guilty about the fact I wasn\u2019t there for him because I was too busy fucking around in college? He gave me everything, and I gave him loneliness while someone brutally murdered him. \n\nI can never understand why I feel this way, and why everything in my life is going to shit. I\u2019m so very tired and done with the world. When my mom died March 2019, I thought that was what finally broke me, but then I started to get better. I went to counseling, I leaned on my friends, and I started to cope better. I honestly thought that everything was finally looking up, but the world likes to put people like me back in their place. The more I think about it, the more I consider the fact that I\u2019m probably meant for misery and this is why the world constantly kicks me back down when I start to get back on my feet. Coming home for spring break was a mistake as well. My father has done nothing but make me feel worse inside, and I have done nothing but be a recluse in my room watching Netflix. I have started to draw away from my support system too, not because they\u2019ve done anything wrong but because I am tired of bothering them and they all have their own things going on in life without me coming around to be the depressed sack of shit that I am. \n\nI wish I hadn\u2019t failed my suicide attempts in the past. I wish I was selfish, naive, and brave enough to try again. I wish I didn\u2019t feel these things inside. Everyone would probably be better off without me anyway. My mom would be alive, my sweet baby would be alive, because I guarantee it was karma towards me that took them away.

It's not that I don't think anyone would miss me, it's the fact that I don't honestly care if they would or wouldn't. I feel like if they knew the extreme pain and mental anguish I'm in from the events my life has drug me through, they would understand my want for release. The constant cheating of exes, the constant deception and pain from being tossed away over and over again. The uselessness I feel of getting out of bed because the same vicious cycle awaits me every single day of my life! I'm tired. I'm tired of giving myself to others, putting myself out there and making myself vulnerable, just to wash, rinse, and repeat a thousand times more. Is it time for me to go? Does it matter? I want to know if in death I will find release. I want to know if separation from this world allows me to find peace once again. One thing is sure, I am scared...but also...not.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question. Determine whether this person is depressed or wants to suicide? '.

A bit of back ground information, I am a 22 year old that has been suffering from severe depression for the past year, with suicidal thoughts everyday of every hour. I felt like I was already dead cause no one seemed to notice me and I was slowly wasting away from the inside out. I also began to hear voices that would constantly berate me and tell me to kill myself, and after this, I sought help from my GP and was put onto anti-depressants (Sertraline) which did absolutely nothing. They didn\u2019t make it worse, but they certainly didn\u2019t make it better.\n\nI was then put onto another anti-depressant (Mirtazapine) which I started taking at the beginning of February 2020, which seemed to help. I had the energy to finally get out of bed, take a shower and leave the house. But a couple of weeks ago, I noticed that although I had the energy to get up and go about my daily life, I was still thinking about killing myself everyday, but this time it was different as I had the energy and motivation to actually come up with a detailed plan and go through with it; and this scared me so much as I have never felt an urge to kill myself as much as I have in the last couple of weeks. \n\nSo yesterday, I had a lot to deal with. My partner has been very sick with an unknown illness for nearly a year, so his parents rushed him to hospital. I was an absolute mess as I have been really struggling to \nsilence the suicidal thoughts, whilst also fulfilling my duty as a carer for my partner. I had a mental breakdown after they took him to the hospital as the voices wouldn\u2019t stop. I actually began shouting back at them, but after a few minutes sobbing on the bathroom floor, I became completely numb and decided to follow through with my plan. \n\nI grabbed my supplies, which involved a dog lead, but I had made sure to buy this one especially for this occasion as it perfectly fit around my neck and had a sturdy metal clip which I could attach to the banister which would hold my weight. I was ready to do it, I was ready to go, and I put the collar around my neck and began to push my neck down into the collar to cut off the blood supply to the main artery in my neck, I heard this would only take a minute or so to make me unconscious, and the whole time I was holding my dog close to my chest cause I was so scared, but I wanted to die so badly. As I could feel myself going, I stopped. And I don\u2019t know what stopped me, but part of me thought that it wasn\u2019t my time to go. So I ended up picking up the phone and calling someone, who managed to calm me down and helped me look at everything from a different perspective. \n\nI know a lot of people will say that it\u2019s selfish for feeling suicidal or committing suicide due to the hurt it would cause to family/friends etc but from what I felt yesterday, none of that mattered. I truly believed that I wanted to die, and if I hadn\u2019t have stopped myself when I had, I would probably be dead now. \n\nBut this morning, my partner finally got an official diagnosis of what has been making him so ill. I am currently sat in the hospital waiting for him to come out of surgery, and I have been told by the doctors that he is going to live a very healthy, normal life after this operation. If I had have killed myself yesterday afternoon, I would never have gotten to find out that my partner was going to be okay. I would never get to marry him in April. I would never get to see him healthy and happy again. All of these things I would have never known if I was dead now. I can now look forward to being able to spend time with my partner who can now start to enjoy his life again, and I can try and enjoy mine as much as I can knowing that he will be around for a long time. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to get at after my long ass story, is that if there is any sort of hope you can cling onto, whether thats a friend, a pet, something you\u2019ve got planned in the near future, or even just the feeling of the sun on your skin. Anything to get you through each day. You never have know when your life could take a turn for the best, or if something amazing will happen; and all of these things you will never get to experience if you end it all now. I\u2019m not here to say that you shouldn\u2019t do it, because at the end of the day, I\u2019m just some stranger on the internet that you don\u2019t know. But what I do know is that things can always get better. Always. But you never know when; and you\u2019ll never know if you\u2019re not here.\nAs a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

But the damage was already done, i started school a pretty normal happy kid with a fair few friends who didnt think about much besides what pokemon i needed to catch to fill my national dex or if i the cartoon i wanted to watch was recorded but by my last year i was could barely be bothered to do anything, i didnt talk to anyone i simply went to school and got the bus home and avoided people at all costs, i had skipped way too much school to get good grades and i could motivate myself to want to study, i was getting the bare minimum to get into 6th form and hopefully that was enough to scrape by. But as if things wern't bad enough i went on a residential school trip with one of my classes that was cut short because I ended up having a severe athsma attack when we got the the accommodation camp, this was my first time having an athsma attack and my first time i'd have ever been to hospital and i was only 15 so my first feelings were obviously of extreme panic, a small part of me i'd say was honestly relieved, maybe this was the end and i wouldnt have to go on, the ambulance got there and i must have asked the responded a hundred times if i was going to die, obviously she cant tell a child 'probably' so she said no and was comforting me, the ride to the hospital felt like an eternity. To wrap this part up obviously i didnt die but i had woken up a week later in the icu surrounded by my family, it was weird seeing my dad and mum together as well as their partners because they had been split up for a long time but i was just happy i woke up i guess. I had to stay in hospital for a few days more after i woke up for tests and rehab, getting used to walking again after being in bed for a week was interesting and a lot harder than i ever thought it would be, i was told that people who suffer acute asthma attacks generally have a low survival rate, i cant remember the exact number but it was low enough to cause a reaction from everyone. We left the hospital and i was told i wouldnt be able to go back to school for at least a month, obviously any kid would be thrilled to hear that but i was super happy because it meant time away from hell on earth. \n\nHowever the recovery process during that month kind of set the precedent for a hole i got trapped in and am still trapped in, doing nothing for a month meant i got into some pretty lazy habits but also i got used to being on my own world just playing xbox and watching tv during the day. Transitioning back into school life was harder than anticipated because it was half days to start off with and that was for about 2 weeks. Fast forward a bit and the bullying starts again because fuck it why not bully the kid fresh out of hospital right? it gets to exam period and i have full on sacked off school, i skip most days and get put into the assisted education program where you take exams in a different room and have a personal TA and some counselling sessions, of course none of this really helped me because i just didnt have any care for my education i just wanted away from school asap. I by some miracle without studying at all managed to scrape by with enough GCSE qualifications to go to 6th form on the condition that i would have to take english and maths alongside a foundation year. This leads onto my next problem:\n\nFor more reasons unknown to me which i can only chalk up to she cant be bothered, my mum decided for me that i wasnt going to go to a college in my hometown, i would have to instead go to live with my dad and do my 3 years of college there. Now i should probably explain why this is a problem, my dad and I dont get on well, we havent for as long as i stopped being a child and we still have barely any real relationship, i just talk to him like once a month to talk to my little brother and sister who obviously i have no reason to not have a relationship with. I wont go into as much detail here because this post is already feeling too long but theres so much more to get through. Long story short my dad was extremely emotionally abusive, anything that he didnt like would be met with screaming banging on things and threats of physical violence, this would be for anything from not doing the dishes to not studying earlier than what was on my plan. This again warped my view of education because i wasnt really doing courses i enjoyed but rather what was available to me and i didnt feel inspired to commit to it by studying, most of my study time was just sneaking my phone on silent. This went on for 3 years straight, i was isolated, the only person i really interacted with was my abusive dad and my teachers and classmates when i had to. When i tried to confide in my mother she simply told me other people including herself had it worse and hes just strict and does it because he cares about me and wants whats best. So i gave up on that as well. Throughout my life one of the few things i really enjoyed was playing video games and I used it as an escape to just ignore my real life situation and responsibilities, how healthy that is is up for debate but if i didnt have that escape who knows if i'd even be typing this here now. He didn't like that i played video games because he said that it was pointless and took away time i could be studying or looking for work, so he took it away and never let me have it back on any occasion after half of the first year. \n\nThats when things got really bad for me, without something to pass the time and take my mind off of things my depression and suicidal tendencies came flooding back, i started self harming and i still look at the scars along my arms sometimes and get reminded of how bad things were back then, i never thought that they would still be there 6 years later, i wish i had thought about that. Somehow 3 years later again without really putting in any effort i managed to complete my A levels and get enough points to get into University. on a foundation entry degree, I guess this was when i was happiest because i was finally free from my parents and maybe i could be someone new and different, I never would have imagined myself where I am now 4 years ago.\n\nUni life started off fine, i was still avoiding people and keeping to myself but a couple of people on my course would always sit next to me and try to talk to me, I guess because seeing someone sitting on their own in their first year of Uni made them want to include me so i even managed to have friends, the first year had some hardships because i was never taught how to budget or be independent so of course money got tight towards the end but aside from that i don't think my first year had any issues, i passed without any issues and found myself advancing to the first year of the actual degree. I wont go into detail for every year but i'll just say that apart from the odd times we'd go out together I still mostly stayed in my flat playing games or watching stuff online, I didnt party and I didnt study, I just kind of drifted, then for whatever reason i cannot remember i got into an argument with my mum, i cant remember what about but she sent me a message saying that she was done with me and i didnt really know what to feel, I just kind of stopped, I stopped going to uni, i stopped going out i stopped everything, i just started spending every day waking up, playing games and eating junk food, sleep, repeat. As you can imagine having a lifestyle like this really did a number on my mental and physical health. I would go an entire week without showering sometimes more, my only human contact was taking my food from downstairs, this was my lowest point. \n\nObviously i failed the year because i didnt attend or do all the work. The next year i was allowed to stay at the Uni and take up a different course, thinking that i could just power through it, but apparently during all of this student finance (the company that pays your tuition fees) turned around and said they wouldn't fund this year of learning for me, which obviously kind of fucked me over completely. Because they told me I wouldn't be funded i decided that there was no point in going, because i certainly don't have 9k just laying around to pay the fees myself, I didn't attend a single lecture all year and lived the same unhealthy life i had lived towards the end of the previous year for the entire year, it was horrible. The one beacon of hope that i could find was that eventually i had to start benefits as i didnt get money to pay the rent or anything so that covered that, meanwhile there was a local game store that ran a tournament for the game a play and i really enjoyed going to that once a week and made friends with the team i was assigned to, my life finally felt like it had some form of normality, i had a decent friend group, i was finally going out and i had something to look forward to whilst i tried to find proper work to fill my time and move into my own place, but unfortunately i couldnt find work and it came time to decide what i was going to do next in the summer, at this time i had another argument with my mum because she began to catch on that clearly something was wrong and i didnt want to go to university and do a degree i had no interest in.\n\nWe hadn't spoken in almost a month and i was sure we had cut ties but then she messaged me pleading me to come to an open day for a course that did in all honestly sound extremely appealing to me so i went and the place seemed nice and this where I am now, i got onto the course and i'm currently here now in the same situation but worse that i was in for the 3rd year at the previous uni, i havent attended almost any of the classes i'm almost certainly going to be kicked out or have to retake the year, but thats not even the worst part, the worst part is that i'm still being asked to pay for other years that i was told would be funded including this year, meaning i'm in an insane amount of debt with no way to pay it off, this year also isn't being funded despite being told it would be and i'm currently in negative balance in my bank account with the next payment of my underfunded maintenance loan coming in on the 20th of next month, i havent eaten in 3 days already and i dont feel all that good, my parents aren't an option and i have tried to ask for help in the loans/assistance reddits but i got marked as a scammer because i wasn't getting any replies but kept trying, I don't know what to do, I think I am well and truly ready for the end, I don't see how I can recover from this hole i put myself into, I'm 23 years old, with no degree, debt, no work experience meaning i cant get any jobs despite the 100's of applications i've probably sent off by now, i've never had a romantic partner, hell i've never even had a real best friend, i'm completely alone and I don't think anyone will miss me when i'm gone.\n\nI'm sorry this was such a long read, but I don't have anyone else to talk to and really explain things to, so this is my last resort, I dont think i want to die, but i really don't see how I can live on.\nAs a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

That said, this is something that I feel I must be open about in order to come to terms with it. To contextualise, I'm a 16 year old girl and I'm originally from Eastern Europe, but I now live in the UK. This may be a very long read and I'll be sure to TL;DR.\n\nI was diagnosed with autism at the age of 4. I'm not 'low functioning' (for lack of a better term; feel free to suggest one) per se, but to other people, it's pretty obvious that I am developmentally disabled. I have poor fine motor skills, struggle to articulate my thoughts and am extremely susceptible to meltdowns when not on birth control (I'll explain this later).\n\nFor most of my early childhood this was largely not a huge issue in my life. I received good support and people were usually empathetic towards my struggles. However, things started to go slowly and then eventually very dramatically downhill once I got my period age 10.\n\nMy parents noticed that I had menstrual cycles that were on average around 21 days in length. Initially, they weren't too worried and assumed they would eventually become more regular as time went on. They didn't. They became shorter, and when I last calculated them, my cycles lasted 18 days on average. This messed up my hormones and I became extremely depressed. This depression peaked around my period. I don't mean that I got typical premenstrual symptoms; in the days leading up to my period, I would self harm, have suicidal thoughts, experience very violent and dramatic mood swings, become extremely sensitive to sound and texture and lose interest in my hobbies and friends. I suggested possibly having PMDD but this idea was dismissed by my parents and doctors.\n\nI first attempted suicide when I was either 13 or 14 (but definitely no older). I didn't inform my parents of this, but only because I didn't want to upset them or make them feel like they had failed me as parents, because they definitely didn't. I then attempted once more aged 15.\n\nDuring this time period I was prescribed the combined oral contraceptive pill. Theoretically, I am supposed to 'tricycle' them, or in other words, take three months' worth of packs and then take a break. I did this until the second most recent attempt in October of last year. This was the first one that I told anybody about and you may not be shocked to hear that it happened whilst I was on a 'period break'. I went to A&amp;E the next day, where I waited for seven hours before being seen by a therapist for twenty minutes who told me that I seemed to have things 'under control' and took no action except refer me to another therapist, who I had one appointment with where I heard the same thing. It was my mother's birthday that day and I have not forgiven myself for making her spend it in A&amp;E. She stayed mostly collected throughout it all but I could tell she felt very upset and shaken. Since this, I have stopped taking breaks and now do not have periods at all. This is massively helpful but my situation is still not great.\n\nIt's partly for that reason that I didn't inform her of my most recent attempt in December. It was also because I was due to fly to Canada the day after the attempt and couldn't bring myself to jeopardise the trip. I considered calling a suicide hotline once I was in Montreal but ended up not doing it, mainly because when I looked up numbers to call, I couldn't find one in Quebec that offered English counselling, but also because my mother discouraged it because of what we would be charged (please remember, she didn't know that I had attempted suicide).\n\nI'm in Year 11, which in the UK is the final year of high school. I'm currently caught up in revising for my GCSEs, which I'm doing OK with from an academic perspective, but struggling to cope with mentally. I'm also being bullied; less than in previous years but still in a way that fucks me up even though I pretend it doesn't. I used to be targeted for my personality and mannerisms, which I've given up being upset about since I've accepted that I don't carry myself typically. Recently, though, they've shifted to targeting my appearance.\n\nThis may make me sound shallow, but as a 16 year old girl, having my appearance mocked and scorned is completely crushing. A few months ago it was never something I gave much thought and I never felt insecure about my appearance outside of typical concerns teenage girls have. People call me 'ugly' and laugh at me to my face. I've never been in a relationship of any kind and, at the risk of sounding like an incel, this does not give me hope for the future and makes me question if I am physically attractive to anybody. It makes me feel arrogant for having ever thought that there was nothing wrong with the way I look. And I'm starting to spiral emotionally because of it. 15 year old me would have laughed at the idea of me being so insecure about my physical appearance, but for me, it was one of the few things I had genuine confidence and pride in and now it is being taken from me.\n\nI feel very shallow and fragile for feeling this way. I'm 16 and have four attempts to my name and it's embarrassing. I hate that I'll never really be able to disassociate myself from that because this isn't what I want to look back on in 10 or 20 years time.\n\nTL;DR I'm a 16 year old autistic girl who has attempted suicide 4 times and is now reconsidering due to bullying concerning my physical appearance.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

I am usually a pretty happy Person. I like doing fun Things like going out with Friends who ive known pretty much all my life (im 23 ) and i have a passion which Is Film making. But Since i started with school even at a Young age i always had Problems concentrating and focusing at School it just isnt for me because I don\u2019t see the benefits from it. I also think the school system is extremly outdated. Last September I started my education ( I live in Germany and the English word for ausbildung translates to education.. ) I work in a world known firm which im not going to name because of a couple of reasons which aren\u2019t related to my problem though. I would say it\u2019s pretty fun because all of my co workers and bosses are pretty nice and always want me to succeed and do good. I\u2019m also pretty good at this job. Even though I got a lot for me going in this particular job I don\u2019t really see me self working in this job for the rest of my life. I\u2019d rather make a living doing films. But I could imagine working for a few years while working for my dream and that\u2019s not a problem. But school is a major problem for me (in Germany you have to go to school while being in Vocational training, another word for the German word Ausbildung) it\u2019s not that easy and I am literally crying everyday that I come from school ( School is 2 times a week ) I can\u2019t concentrate well in school and I miss a lot of school material while trying to focus on a topic. When I have to write an exam I become depressed as f*ck from Studying. Everytime I Imagine working or having school I have suicidal thoughts and can\u2019t get out of my bed for days sometimes. These thoughts are sometimes so bad, I imagine myself to end it all.. I also have a girlfriend which is my biggest supporter and the best human you could ever imagine. She gives everything trying to cheer me up and help me with my problems while working a 9 to 5 job. We want to marry and this is why I even got this job. Because of cultural reasons her family won\u2019t let her get married unless her future husband gets a \u201csecured\u201d Vocational training in case something happens in life that I have something to fall back on. Me and her have the same outlook on this \u201ccultured\u201d living, it\u2019s f*ckin stupid. I can understand her parents as well but it\u2019s just that I am at a totally burned out point in my life that I can\u2019t get motivated to finish this all.

Art has been my passion since I was a little kid and I hope I can one day have an exhibition showcasing my art. \n\nSo back in 2019 just a few months after graduating college I applied for this artists residence program. I knew that I probably wouldn't get accepted as these\u00a0 residences are usually very popular and I was still buliding up my\ncareer in art. But I still wanted to try and get more experienced in writing applications and though I'd give it a go and you never know I might just be lucky enough to be accepted. \nThis particular application had to be sent in by post. So I asked my mum for a stamp. Later that day my dad sees the stamp booklet and asks what it was doing there. So my mum told him. He just conpleatly lost his shit and started yelling at my mum. He was arngry that my mum hadn't told him about my plans to apply for this residence. I could hear the yelling from my bedroom and came down to see what it was about. \n\nI can't remember everything that happened and what was said. But basically my dad felt that this was a terrible idea. That the residence wouldn't be good for me and that I shouldn't be moving out. \nI kept trying to explain how there were many benefits of doing this residence. And how I wouldn't be moving away forever. Besides I was 23 at the time. A lot of people my age had lived away from their parents. He, however, couldn't get his head around it. He thought the residence program wasn't legitimate. Despite the fact that I  found out about it through my college lectures and how they literally give us seminars on how to apply to these residences. \n\nHe keep yelling and screaming causing my mum to cry and sleep in my sister's room that night. \n\nI didn't let the events of that night keep me from pursuing my dream. Fast forward to a few days ago and I'm working on another application for a artist residence. This one also has to be sent in by post. So this time I tell my dad what I'm doing just before he went to bed. He rolled his eyes but didn't say much. \nThe next day I'm printing off my application and I can hear my dad speaking negativity about this residences to my mum.\n\nMy mum is so kind and loving and supportive of me and my dreams. I really couldn't ask more of her. \nAnyway. I come into the room and tell my dad that I can hear him talking about me. \nHe says similar stuff to what he said back in 2019. How he's thinks its a bad idea. How he thinks I shouldn't be moving out. He is of the belief that I'm looking at this with rose tinted glasses. I try to explain how I'm not some stupid little kid just following some whimsical dream. This is my passion. Its the thing I have a degree in and very much plan on pursuing. \n For some reason he cannot understand what a \nresidence involves. I thought the team residence made it fairly obvious. However I try to explain how its a place you live and work in. So you can produce artwork in a proper studio. He's still just shaking his head saying its a bad idea. I ask him why he thinks its a bad idea but he just cuts me off and tells me to tell him why its a good idea.\nOnce again I try to explain the benefits. Because I'm just making small bits of Watercolour paintings in my bedroom and having a studio would be so much more ideal.\nHe stars asking questions about how they chose people. I explain about how you send in a cover letter, an artist cv, and images of your work.\n\nFor some reason he keeps referring to the residence as a course. My mum and I tell his how its not a course its a place to live and work. He doesn't seem to understand. \nHe says how the only people who will benefit from this course are the people running in. \n\nHe seems to believe that because I wouldn't be paid to attend this residence that its a waste of time. \nI'm not even asking my parents for money to fund this residence. I planned to pay the rent myself. \nThe he says how I should be looking for work. He's a bit of a booomer. He seems to think that there's loads of jobs going round and I just couldn't be bothered to get one. Not true. \n\nI had a job not too long ago but it was temporary contract work which ended a few weeks ago. \n\nHe has the nerve to say that when he, himself has been unemployed since the early 2000s and my mum is the main breadwinner.\n He just happens to be related to wealthy parents whom he inherited loads of money from when they died. He doesn't know the struggle of looking for work or having a strict budget. \nI asked if he'd prefer if i were in some dead end job that made me miserable. No he says. He'd like to see me in a job that makes me happy. And he sort of suggests to continue with art on the side but apparently working and doing an art residence is just too much. \n\nAnyway, getting back on track. He mentioned how he thinks I'm too vulnerable and not ready to move out. I don't know how he's going to react when I have enough money saved up to move out. But he can't stop me from moving out and living my own life. I haven't even been accepted by the residence program and he's acting as if I'm leaving to live on the other side of the world.\nEverything up to this point has been very upsetting and stressful and depressing. But than he goes and says that I'm not good enough or talented enough. Thst these no future in this residences. No future in art. \n\nThat fucking hurt but I highly suspected this. I told him that I already knew that. This man hasn't even seen half of my art. Hasn't see what I'm capable of doing. And doesn't understand how the art world works. If I were bad I wouldn't have gotten my BA. It's still so hard to not let his words get to me. I'm still planning on applying for open calls to residences and exhibitions. I know i have talent and I work hard. Even if I'm not currently good enough that doesn't mean I should stop. The only thing that will stop me from having a future in art is if I give up. So I won't give up until I have made it.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question. Determine whether this person is depressed or wants to suicide? '.

I love my friends and family, I want them to be proud of me, but there is nothing about me to be proud of. Until recently, I have tried my best with everything. Studying, socializing, classes I was taking, everything. I had the motivation of making my parents and friends proud. Of being a useful human being so they can love me. So I can be loveable. I lost that motivation recently. When my parents said that I am not good enough, said my younger sister is better than me and laughed. I got pissed and told them I was trying my best and they told me that I wasn't and that my result grades were the evidence. (I got 2 B's in math and social studies by 0.1 and 0.2 difference each, otherwise all A)They called me dumb and that they regret spending so much money on me if I was going to be this way, not working hard and not getting the best results. They said that I was acting depressed for no reason and I am whining about my life because I am spoiled. To break me completely my father said he is losing motivation to go to work and earn money because I am wasting it. Then my mother said I disappoint her. It is my fault that I couldn't get straight As on everything and I admit that I could have done better if I pushed myself harder, I admit that I should have done that but those words did hurt a lot for me. At that point, I still wanted to impress my friends but then my parents told me they won't want to hang out with me if I keep this up and continue being dumb, useless and not helpful. That made me feel like every effort I'm making is useless. Nobody ever told me I was doing a good job, my parents didn't compliment me whatsoever. I am done. I was diagnosed with depression and even then my parents never took me seriously saying that I lied. I want to be a loveable person and be loved. These days I have no motivation to do anything. I just want to die. May sound like I am whining, but my parent's validation were all I want and what I lived for until now. I don't know what to do and I dont even know what I am writing here but I just really, really want to die, disappear so my parents dont have to waste their hard earn money on me anymore, and could support my talented younger sister instead.

After a few days alone I'm sure I'll be desperate enough to properly follow through with suicide and I seriously can't wait. Has anyone else ever felt giddy about the prospect of killing themselves?\n\nAlso, I'm currently stuck with my parents and god it's frustrating to want to scream and shout that FINALLY I GET TO DIE!!!!! but they're sensitive bitch asses would try to stop be so I have to bite my tongue constantly and man is it hard.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

I'm feeling really helpless to be honest. I feel like a burden, like a parasite. Every day, pain is with me. Joy is temporary. I surrender at this point. My childhood has been a mess with my dysfunctional parents. I've never been good. If you want to have an idea, my mother has a borderline personality disorder, which means she was violent, physically and emotionally. My father is narcissistic, he abused me emotionally, making me feel like a burden. Never keeping his promises. I've never been happy for a long time with them. I'd say, for my life, 10% happy, 90% in pain. Now I'm 21, I don't know how I survived at this point, but I reached my limit. I tried to take my life away, wasn't a success. My family learned it, and for a moment I thought they finally considered me, but it was for such a short amount of time. I'm always walking on eggs with my parents. I'm in university right now, and it's hard. I just don't have the energy and will to persevere. My energy level is low, very low. I've tried therapy, meds, taking walks, doing sports. But every time I feel like I finally got my life together, something happens and it goes down. For example, I thought I could have some hope two weeks ago, then my cat died. She was my real family, I really loved her and she was always there for me, she kinda helped me a lot with her caring presence. It destroyed me. Then I tried again, but now I've got issues again with the parents. I'm exhausted. I don't have the strength to continue this life. I'm helpless. I sincerely considered ending everything this week.

I've dealt with depression since my early teen's. It continued to be a major problem in my life until about my mid 20s when I met my current partner. Because of how emotionally mature, supportive and trusting he was, I felt my espisodes we not as frequent or as severe. However as I began to hit my 30s, I started to notice the larger issues that I overlooked when I was younger as not important, like his finanical health (how he views money/saving). He holds a job with little responsibility and low-stress but pays as such (i.e. near minimum wage). He did work overtime for a time to afford a house, which he has but needs me to pay half the mortgage in order to afford it. He says I'm the love of his life but he's not interested in getting married. He's also almost nearly a decade older than me.\n\nI feel trapped because as much as I love him, I want to leave. The major reasons I want to leave are different views towards finances, marriage and moving (he doesn't want to move away from where his parents live). I've been wanting to leave for a very long time but I'm also scared. This decision has caused my anxiety then depression to spring up full force, comptemplating suicide because I'd rather die than live on my own. I haven't lived on my own since my early 20s and every time I lived alone it would result in me being suicidal nearly every day. I struggled, graduated late in college and managed a business degree that did nothing, but earn me an unstable job history and act as a cover to people that I'm doing okay. I just realize how emotionally dependent I am on him and that scares me too. I have no family or friends to talk to about this or for any emotional support. I also hate the state I live in as there are many bad memories here of past abuse. My parents also live here and our relationship remains strained.\n\nWhat I want is to move out of this city and start over but I don't know if that's my depression talking or what. I don't trust my own decisions or judgements. I have low esteem for myself and my choices. Back to the reasons for leaving my partner though---I feel like who am I to say what I want in a relationship since for instance, I can't even hold a steady job so again, makes it hard to leave him. I'm also currently in school again to once more try a job more suitable to my personality--massage. Until then, I'm stuck living with him for another 6 months.\n\nHow do you find the courage to live on your own? Past that, how do you find the will or care to live? I don't have anyone. I mean, I won't have anyone if I leave him and that scares me into staying with him too. Or should I just stay with him and work things out? I'm not sure. I just know I can't sleep well, don't eat much and been crying every other day. Sometimes I just would rather die than have to make a life decision...\n\n\\---\n\nAre people with mental illness subjected to whatever relationship they can get? Should we be lucky to even have a partner that puts up with us?\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

The only things that actively stops me is maybe the fact I don't want paramedics or my family finding my body. It sounds sick and conceeded but I sometimes think I'm too fat to be found. (Haha ironic) \n\nI made a deal with myself that I would reach a certain weight and then slowly kill myself via starvation or exhaustion. I know how painful that could be but I deserve it. I'm a poor excuse for a human being. I've tried speaking with family and friends.

But I also feel as tho if I end it then there wouldn\u2019t be that worry I\u2019d then be gone. if I speak to my friends about it they\u2019ll just turn around and say man up or stop being soft.

Me and my ex split 6 months ago a short term relationship but that was one thing I felt really happy about and that ended because of how I am, just sad and perhaps not all there, or perhaps I\u2019m just not capable in being in a relationship as there\u2019s just clearly something wrong with me.

Generally, I am a calm person - an introvert (more ambivalent), I liked being with myself, I liked to help, I was quite specific, very empathetic, although I stayed with other normal cool people.  I couldn't be a dick.\n Over time, I noticed that I stand out.  Others went somewhere, spent time, etc. Problems started in high school when it came to partying, crazy outings.  Everyone snapped, told their exits as if it was unknown.  And I didn't have anyone but one friend.  I found that something was wrong with me and I began to change.  I wanted to reprogram, upload other more extroverted software.  At that time I had a completely distorted picture of reality.  And for example - I have always been balanced and did not make quick, ill-considered decisions.  Seeing that others don't do it, I suppressed it and added it to my new \"software\".  Seeing that others do not respond immediately to the huts also so began to do.  These small, seemingly low risk examples have changed me.  There were plenty of them.  I did so with everything.  I know it's sick but it was so.  I began to think what other people's lives were like.  I wanted to experience these beautiful moments that I heard and told them myself.  It lasted a long time.  My current personality was changed.  I copied every behavior and thinking patterns of the \"better\" ones I took an example of. After half a year, I got depressed. I felt terrible. Memory loss, pits. I realized what I had done and wanted to unprogram. I began to think, I analyzed my personality a lot  , what should change, how to behave and feel. I tried to remember my previous identity. I had so many copied habits that I didn't know how to behave, feel, think. I didn't feel like myself, as if unreal, in a dream, without contact  with feelings, emotions.\n The situation continues to this day.  I do not know who I am.  I don't feel anything, I don't feel myself.\n The only thing keeping me alive is the awareness that it used to be good and it's all in my head.  I often have thoughts of suicide.\n I have sick thoughts - I classify people according to their qualities that are useful and not, I divide people into better and worse.  I do not feel anything.\n Not once during these 4 years did I feel alive.  No sadness, no shot of joy, no intense feeling.\n He constantly compares himself to others.  I do not know how to be myself - I look at others, I wonder what they feel, how they think, what chances I would face against them.  The psychologist and therapy did nothing.  Now he keeps in touch with a psychologist who tells me to stop thinking and follow my feelings\n I try to do it but I still want to write it.  I feel lost.  The only thing keeping me alive is reason.  Nothing else.  He tells me he thinks it all.  I don't remember what it's like to be happy.  I do not know who I am.\n Thank you for reading and advice.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

I was curious, so I asked something related to it (sorry, can't remember exactly :(, I think I said something like \"Oh! What movie?\" or \"When?\" (like when would this event take place) ). She then rudely replies with \"Who are YOU!?\". This other girl from my friend group just stared at me (Not in a rude way, but in a way I can't read her expression) I was kind of hurt then.\n\nThis behaviour kept continuing. Around a few days later, I went to the spot where my friends sat, and sat next to the girl who apparently dislikes me. She IMMEDIATELY stood up and rushed (no kidding, she ran away from me) to the opposite side, and sat there. I just blankly stared at her, again hurt the frick for me. The group stayed silent, then same girl who looked at me then said \"Oh, I know why\".\n\nBecause of this, I was in a shit mood. The shittiest mood I've been compared to the whole day. I was walking to my HSIE class (where 2 of my other \"friends\" were in). I asked one of them, (for her privacy, I'll call her \"Sally\") why (let's call her Fiona) keeps avoiding me. Sally replies saying I said something to Fiona *A FEW MONTHS AGO* that pissed her off. Sally then tells me to not worry, and that Fiona is a *\"petty person\"* . (Honestly, I thought okay, wtf? I actually was actually tearing up a bit due to sadness, not to the extent of crying though)\n\nTimeskip to a few days, (with Fiona going to the opposite side of the friend circle *As AlWaYs!1!,* and with me now, I try no to be near her, but even being the slight nearest, she goes even further away). I asked someone who was friends/close to Fiona while going out of my commerce class to the next period. I explained the situation to her (*whilst clinging to the edge of the wall like that Yandere girl from Yandere simulator because I am awkward af, seriously*). She also responds to something similar. She said Fiano used to act up like that to her and I just need to get used to it. (I was tearing up AgAin (not to the extend to cry) \\*le fucking sigh\\*). She then adds \"Oh, you don't like it?\". She then says something similar that Sally said before \"She is just petty\" (ugh so tired of hearing that word from everyone).\n\nTimeskip\\~\\~\n\nShe keeps avoiding me, not sitting next to me. Recently I was going to the bathroom with another girl, whilst walking back to class, Fiona responds \"Hey -name-\" and ignores me (wow, how nice...). When I talk, she glares at me. And more, more, MORE negative reactions to me.\n\nToday, I had HSIE class after lunch. I was 'complaining' (not in an annoying way) about how boring it was. And then fucking Piano responds with \"Maybe if you had friends\".\n\nI pause, literally a flash of emotions hit me: hurtfulness, pain, frustration, anger, you name it. I had just enough with her play and said something around (maybe I should of responded differently, more direct? and not nicely?) \"Why do you hate me, whatever you did, just tell me, I will say sorry\" and blah blah blah. (Sorry, I only started to notice I was too kind this year, and that it lead to me being hurt, and people taking the advantage to go on top of me (yeah, there are a few girls, again? why would you hate me?, who dislike me. I won't talk about it because this thread would be WAYYY too long) ).\n\nFiona then replies with \"Nothing/No you did nothing wrong. \\*I just hate you.\" .\\*I was spreading in a bad mood. Bad morning, had a maths test, didn't sleep because I was staying up studying and also extremely VERY stressed!\n\nThe group went silent, stopped talking. I had enough, I don't want to be apart of the group (explain later). I don't want to be near HER. I. fucking.had.enough. I abruptly left the group (sorry, should've mentioned earlier, but I do that more and more often when she does something shitty to me) and walked around, staring at happy (I mean I don't really know) people with their friends, fake smiling.(ugh for some reason I approached some closely just to stare at them.\n\nUgh fucking amazing life.\n\nAlso I will talk about my friends now.\n\nThey weren't a fixed group, especially around 8th grade. You know when there is a new student, and the teacher would just ~~force~~ put them in your group? Well, welcome to mine!\n\nAnyways, my group is basically where new people come. There has been 1 from 8th grade (never met her before) and an old friend who came back(left). There would be another girl who would hang out in my group and another one (that one more now). This year, 9th grade, already on our 6th week, 2 girls were introduced (I don't even remember their names).\n\nThere are certain things that creates a friend group. For example, if you like books, you stay with bookworms (the \"bookworm group\"). Because of this (tho, nothing like that made me feel close to my friends), my friends group isn't so closely connected to one another. Like lunch is so fucking boring now. When was the last time I had fun during recess or lunch?(Note\\_ 4 out of 5 days I have school meetings on lunch, just SRC things!) Now people just eat due to boredom, and half of them go on their phones. No (little) interactions created. I am quiet, but not the most quiet in the group, now I am. When they talk, they laugh, I don't.\n\nBut seriously, I never felt close to my friends, they would go to parties, parks, movies with each other, where am I? at home. They had photos posted on instagram one time of them in a party. They tagged each other, not including ME (only one, thanks. Btw not close to her though). They printed photo cards of those pictures and shared them to each other as memory (some are on their phone case). One picture was the korean hand heart (that saranghaeyo thingy) they made together as a circle. (Wow, like that didn't;t hurt)\n\nIm not close to them, I feel lonely being around them, and I have no one to talk to, no one to trust. Where do I go now? How do I make friends? Because of this, I've reached out bout my loneliness online (in a few different platforms) to talk to. It's nicer to talk to someone online though.. They don't know me and keep this secret...\n\nSorry, this was longer than I thought. There is more I want to talk about (I never thought something that I thought was small would end up being this long). I may post some more in the future.\n\nIf there is something you want me to elaborate on, please feel free to ask! (But I won't respond if it is too personal hehe). I need someone to talk to...\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question. Does this person suffer from suicidal potential or depression? '.

So as you can read back through my posts, I was doing Spravato for a very short time before my insurance pulled the rug out from me. Two weeks into it, that\u2019s right - TWO WEEKS, Insurance comes back after pre-approving my treatment and says since I had not shown a 50% improvement they were denying any further treatments. Thanks for the warning fuckers! So of course my depression and anxiety dropped severely after this happened. Partly because of being pissed and irate and outright shocked about how they could even do this. And second, my body and mind didn\u2019t care for how I just suddenly stopped treatments. So I\u2019ve been on a downward spiral for about two weeks now. \nWell the clinic where I was having the treatments has not really got back to me and kind of dropped me like a bad habit now that they aren\u2019t getting money from my insurance. When the lady called to tell me she said she would talk to the dr in charge of the program and ask him what he wanted to do. That was almost two weeks ago. I\u2019ve spoke to her once since and tried calling several times with no call back. Like seriously ... What the fuck? You have someone who was telling you I was severely depressed and suicidal (enough to get approved for disability - which is not easy to do!) and you\u2019re just gonna fucking ignore my calls and my concerns and let me go to the wayside? What happened to checking with the dr to ask him about a next step? Is that it? Is it just like - well no more Spravato for you so we are done dealing with you?! I\u2019m fed the fuck up quite honestly. And after waiting all week since talking to her Monday, I\u2019m going to call tomorrow and I\u2019m asking to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge of that fucking place. Let me just add also that when I first contacted them to set up my initial appointment, it took almost two months before I got in there! That\u2019s right! Two months! It was the beginning of December when I first called and someone was supposed to call me back and I waited and waited and finally called and went off asking them \u201cdo I have to say I\u2019m suicidal before someone will take me seriously and call me back??\u201d It was soon after I finally got in there but to me that\u2019s a little ridiculous to think of making a suicidal person wait almost two months to start treatment or be evaluated. \nBetween that and the insurance screwing me, I\u2019m truly and utterly fed up. It makes me sick and pissed off how the system fails people like me and then they wonder why mental illness is such an issue and has such a stigma around it! Well no fucking wonder. If others are treated anything like I have been, and I have a feeling that many are, then I can see why people lose their shit and either end up killing them selves or others. Let me clarify - I\u2019m NOT in any way condoning that behavior or saying it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m simply saying that it\u2019s no wonder there\u2019s such an issue with mental illness in this county. \nAll that being said, where does one go from here? I\u2019ve tried therapists, countless medicines, obviously the Spravato - all to come to this. To pretty much be treated as if my life means nothing and completely and utterly ignored! I hate to sound narcissistic, but god damn. My life should be just as important as anyone else\u2019s. \nHere\u2019s the conclusion I\u2019ve pretty much come to in the last 24 hours. I have to stop depending on anyone to help me deal with this fucking sickness. I have to depend on myself to somehow get better. I am the only one who is here for me. Nobody else gives a fuck. Nobody. Why should they? They have nothing invested in me and I mean nothing. If they aren\u2019t getting money from insurance then why bother even returning my phone call right? \nI don\u2019t know. If this is what our society has come to, I seriously want no part of it anymore. It\u2019s disgusting and I am to the point where I hate people in general. I know that sounds bad, but go back up and re-read my post if you really want to try to understand why I am starting to hate people. I wasn\u2019t always this way. Yes, I\u2019ve dealt with mental illness most my life in some capacity or another. But here in the last 5 years it has hit the absolute bottom of the bottom. I look back at times when I thought I was depressed before and I think to myself - I\u2019d give anything to go back to that time and redo things. \nI don\u2019t really have anything else to say. I\u2019ve rambled on enough. I just had to get this all out in some way. If you made it to this and have read my whole post then thank you. You\u2019ve shown more concern than the people who claimed to be there for me and deal with my depression - until the insurance money stopped coming.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

Just want to add, most of the things that my mind perceives as major fucking problems like having no friends or girfriend can be overcome, its not a terminal illness, even if my mind wants me to see it that way. I say this to people a lot but i believe it, with a healthy mind there isnt much a human cant overcome. Look at tyson fury, he was a pork pie with the jelly around it, he was a coke addict. And by getting help with his mental health hes now heavy weight champion of the world. Then people like caroline flack (sorry if i misspelled) got herself in a pretty bad sitaution, and her mental health issues made it seem 1000x worse to her.

At the end of my junior year of high school I had a really bad breakup and lost all my friends causing me to start self harming and isolating myself from everyone. Thankfully, this acquaintance I had took time out of his day to make music with me at lunch. It really meant a lot to me. He was the only friend I really had at the time. I had hung out with his friends a couple times before throughout high school, so I started playing video games with some of them. Eventually during the summer I got really close to them, and I became a part of their friend group. They really brought me out of that dark hole of depression, and I had never loved a group of friends more in my entire life. I had and still am going through extreme social anxiety, but helped me become more confident in myself and alleviated that a bunch. In the beginning of senior year I hung out with them after-school basically everyday, and it was the happiest I\u2019d ever been. \n\nI don\u2019t want to get into details but then something changed. A bunch of the group dynamics changed that made me felt inferior. I thought they thought I wasn\u2019t as funny anymore, and was more weird and awkward. I reverted back to the state I was in with my previous girlfriend, and I started to worry incessantly that I would be abandoned by them. My mindset about the group also changed. I felt like I had to constantly meet their standards and entertain them or else they would abandon me. This has made socializing with them more of a grueling chore than a fun experience. I\u2019ve isolated myself from them a lot, and I even feel a bit of anger towards them. \n\nThere are these events that happen that make me feel like they think I\u2019m weird, awkward, unfunny, and annoying, so I constantly try to change myself. I try to be less talkative, and apply a tight filter to what I say. I hate who I am. I can\u2019t live with myself. I feel like everyone I interact with thinks I\u2019m all of those things, and I can\u2019t stand it. I hate everything about myself. My voice, the way I pronounce things, my mannerisms, my sense of humor, my conversations with people, everything. I can\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nRight now I\u2019m on 50 mg Zoloft. Tonight I\u2019m going to trip on 300 mg robotussin gels. There\u2019s a possibility I could experience extreme even fatal side effects due to serotonin syndrome, but I don\u2019t care anymore. I just want to be taken out of this reality for a while. It\u2019s not even that I\u2019m suicidal. I\u2019m not trying to kill myself. But if that\u2019s what ends up happening, I don\u2019t care.

I'm Dutch.\n\n**Don't read if you are easily triggered. I don't want any of you feel bad/worse.**\n\nOkay, some of you already start typing reasons to stay alive. Y'all are so kind for doing that. I miss kind people. Everyone leaves me 'cuz I'm depressed. And everytime I'm in my deepest point of a 'depression wave', somebody dies. Like life also tries to convince me I should kill myself.\n\nSo I heard in August I could go to a mental hospital in MARCH. So at that point it sounded so far away that I gave up and neglected myself. Cuz everyday was hell. And I was supposed to wait 6 months. **But** of course I was thankfull my psychiatrist got me on the list of the mental hospital that is specialised in autism. So I was too scared to really tell I wouldn't survive until then.\n\nI've been severe depressed in october. Didn't really come out of my room except for diner or to go to the toilet. Selfharmed the whole day long, slept when I was tired, not on a certain time so my sleep rythm was ruined. Gained weight. Couldn't concentrate on anything. Like I was in my mind already fading away. I became sure life was giving my signs that I should die. Everything that could go wrong, DID go wrong. And in my deepest point, my grandma died. I still haven't accept it. Her death didn't feel real for days. It was on the funeral where it felt like life punched me in the head. The amount of emotions were so much that I tried to not be in the reality anymore. Thinking about an alternate life. Writing stories and imagining me in it constantly.\n\nI think that last thing gave me a depersonalisation disorder or something. I don't know how it works and I know I can't diagnose myself. But on moments where I have a lot of emotions or when I'm a little stressed, I feel like I'm watching my body experiencing things. Like I'm the co\u00f6rdinator in my head watching through my eyes. I can't really talk or think cuz I feel like my body should talk or think in that situation. I'm just watching what happens and take decisions.\n\nAnd then late October... I was standing on the edge of the bridge and decided to talk to an old friend, instead of jumping at that moment. (She has DID, and one of her personalities is an agressive one who made me dissociate when she wanted me to kms). You can say she's a bad influence, but she's the only one still standing by me and the only one with the same kind of humor. She has help so the thing that happened last year won't happen again.\n\nAnyway, I became a little happier, started enjoying going outside again. I made friends in a therian community cuz I figured back in August I was a therian too. (whatever your opinion is about 'therians', pls dont post them here cuz this isnt what the post is about)\n\nIdk why, but I knew I was going into a depressed moment again, as I was irritated everyday and selfharming again.... So I landed in the depressed wave again. Or should I say drowning? I don't enjoy anything, every food tastes boring. I can't sleep cuz I cry every damn night. I'm constantly thinking about kms. I'm even trying it, or sort of searching boundaries. Taking pills but just enough to still stay alive. Or standing on the edge of the bridge but not jump.\n\nWhat triggered my to write this post, was because I heard a cat of mine has cancer and he may not survive another week. The cat that shoved his fur in my face :') so I got a little distracted in a traumatising situation which happened 2/3 years ago. (Can't talk about it now cuz PTSD flashbacks will kill me with this amount of emotions I have now) The cat that walks over my legs, jumps in my neck and demands attention when I'm crying on the floor in the middle of the night. He is like my ESA (not official one) And I'm about to lose him. I can't go through this. I can't lose the last string of the rope that I'm holding on the edge of a ravine. I feel like kms at the moment. I don't wanna die. I wanna be of this pain.\n\nAbout the mental hospital in march? 18 days until an apointment to talk about practical stuff. then I have to wait another week (I guess?) to finally be there and be save from myself.\n\nBut plz give me some strenght, some advice. I know I need to hold on these last weeks, but I can't. Every minute of everyday is torture. I don't think I'll survive until then.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question. Determine whether this person is depressed or wants to suicide? '.

I grew up in an emotionally, verbally, and occasionally physically abusive home. My dad became an alcoholic as a result of the abuse from my mom. I became the unwilling referee and parental therapist as a preteen and eventual side punching bag as a teen. My mom has tried to kill me a few times now - some before I was 18, some after, and also kidnapped me as a child after she and my dad had a fight. I spent all of my adolescence waiting for a chance to get out. CPS came twice but nothing ever helped. I got into a dream school and everything as a senior, but that got ripped away too. Mom refused to sign off on loans - which I could not get without a co-signer. There went my escape. \n\nThey divorced. I became the physical punching bag for my mom. I cut my hair off to prevent her from grabbing it. My dad got worse. I tried to kill myself a few times, all of which failed for some reason or another. Got 51/50'd. My mom proceeded to use that as a threat from then on of where she could send me if I didn't behave. I stayed with my dad after that, and cut her off. Still was depressed as fuck though. Only person I could talk to about any of it was my grandma. One night talked to her and my aunt (who's racist and hates me) happened to also be there. She took the phone and screamed at me. Told me never to call my grandma again, told me to stop making up shit about my family and stop talking suicide to an elder. My grandma could handle it, she used to feel that way too - it's why I could talk to her about it. \n\nFast forward a little bit and my dad (just after we finally patched our relationship and things looked better) suddenly died from his drinking problem. I had to go back to my mom because no other relative was an option. My mom immediately took it out on me, and I became terrified to even wake up. She tried to smother me to death, tried to choke me out with an aux cord, tried to shove me down the stairs, tried to push me out of a moving vehicle, etc. Yet every time blamed me. It was the worst year of my life, or so I thought. At least I had my grandma. She was depressed too, over losing her son, and because she was being abused by her daughter (the racist aunt). I was trying to help but it always got covered up somehow. Then exactly one year later, my grandma suddenly died. But she left me half her estate to protect myself, because she wanted me to move out and live near her. She was the only person left that wanted to help me. \n\nBut then my aunt (the one from before) got hissy about the fact that her mom and I were closer than they ever were, and she lawyered up. She refused to give me a key, refused to give me the items my grandma specifically wanted me to have (because no proof), and informed me of the sale well after it happened while I was out of state. She also kept going through my mom, which was idiotic - as my parents divorced and I was an adult. I asked her about it, she dodged, so I wrote a letter. She never contacted me again for months, so I had to get an attorney (that I can't afford tbh) and we've been back and forth on that since. Now she's threatening to file the taxes under my name without my permission without my SSN so the IRS comes after me. All this over fucking recipe cards and a desk!  \n\nI always think about wanting to end it, end the pain, end the inevitable suffering that always comes, but I can't. I can't leave my cats. I refuse to rehome, the word itself hurts me to even type or see. How could I do such a thing to my family? The only ones there for me? Anytime I cry they sit on me and purr or lick my face and one of them legit meows at me until i talk to her and she keeps meowing till i'm done and then snuggles. They are literally the closest to me and the only ones that keep me going. I just wish I could do something for them too (like find a new place to live, but I can't). My mom recently made credit cards under my name and maxed them out. Told me this just so \"I'd understand the position I'm in.\" If anyone asks her she says it's just to help me build my credit. To which I'm sure is somewhat true, because she intends to sign my name off as a cosigner to a property she wants to buy. \n\nTo her I've only ever been a means to an end. I just want out, I don't want to die. I want a place on my own with my cats, safe and sound. But I feel like I'll never get out.

I haven\u2019t been happy for the last four years. The last time I felt that sensation in my brain was my freshman year of college. I was talking to a girl and I could feel the dopamine in my head. That was the last time I felt happy. I\u2019ve been chasing that feeling ever since. The friends have helped make me feel whole. When I\u2019m alone I don\u2019t know what do. I repressed these feelings for a long time. I started watching Bojack Horseman and the feelings came back. Am I a whole person? Am I took messed up too feel love again? I ask myself this every day. When I\u2019m drunk I am able to let these feelings out. I don\u2019t want to be dependent on alcohol to feel this way. I want to talk about my feelings, but I don\u2019t want to be less of a man. Jessica has made me decently happy, but I still don\u2019t feel this way. I don\u2019t want to be dependant on her either. When I beat off I only can finish when I think about personal emotions. I can't even cry anymore. What does that mean? Am I better? I don\u2019t have decency on alcohol. I have stopped for a while and I still feel this way. I don\u2019t know if it is because I\u2019m lonely or because of how messed up I am. When your mother tells you that you should have been a miscarriage you reevaluate life. At the age of thirteen. Is that really an age when you should be questioning your existence? I don\u2019t want pity, I just want to feel normal. When I look at myself I question my life. I have accepted death, but I have also noticed the finite life you have. Once you live, you die. That is scary to me. I just want to cry, but even while writing this I can\u2019t. There are people worse than me, but the way I think about it is, have wasted my life? College is full of life. I haven\u2019t lived one. I wish I was dumb and could fade into the crowd, but I can\u2019t. All I think about is my deathbed and how it won\u2019t be anything. I die and that is it. I\u2019m gone. In high school, I had the same thoughts, but my stepmom said that I\u2019m young and I don\u2019t understand. I find myself having the same thoughts. Maybe nonexistence is fine. I just want to lay in bed and drift away with my mind until I do die. I\u2019m afraid of the loss of thought. Once you're gone your gone. Nothingness. I\u2019m scared. I just want that feeling one more time, but how does happiness happen? Relationship, family, or accomplishment? The future scares me and I don\u2019t want to sit here on shitty earth and have these feelings at fifty. How do people become happy? I\u2019ve lost the feeling and don\u2019t know how to get it back. Once we die that is it. Am I going to die and feel nothing? Is a relationship enough? Or am I broken? I almost want to pass away not think. What does it all mean? Are we just bacteria that evolved enough to think? I want answers, but nobody will tell me.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

I'm dependent on a longtime SO and it makes me feel awful. There have been elements of abuse in the past and I dont think I can fully trust anyone, so I have to do this or die or get a high paying job without a degree or hurting my back(I have a terrible back and neurological problems) I'll be left with something like stripping, or just suicide.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point, classes are getting more intense, I'm already behind in an online class that posted no deadlines, because I'm prioritizing a class in which I work around 30 hours/week to keep my quality high(I'm aiming for A's and this class is supposedly graded harshly-so far I have A's and 1 B on something I worked on for just 10 hours). Anyway, so I am behind in my online classes now, trying to make time to catch up, but seems impossible.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy other in person class doesn't take as much time, I have a 4 hour studio and homework takes me maybe 1-5 hours usually. I have trouble managing time because I hardly see my SO, so when we do see each other, we stay up late and just play games. We havent had any intimacy in about a month, and otherwise it's like a 1-2x/month thing. He doesn't help me with the chores unless I ask a bunch of times even though i made a chore chart for us both to look at,on the fridge, and gave myself more things. He keeps promising he'll do chores,shower,brush his teeth, just basic things, and he doesn't. He actually said he'd do all the chores when I went back to school(like I'd done for him) and not to worry. I worried, but I left things for a bit and realized I was correct in being concerned after the house started looking trashed. If I talk to him he changes the topic or recites some meme. He kisses me maybe twice a day and is otherwise glued to his phone watching YouTube videos- he quit video games as they were time consuming but just switched to videos instead. He's so addicted to his phone that he got his by a bus last year, while I was passenger. He's usually on his phone while driving and there's nothing I can do. I dont drive because of my anxiety, and I dont have a working car. I am very stressed right now and feel totally alone. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI literally dont have time to see a therapist. I dont even have time to see my doctors for checkups. All I do is work, at school,homework,and at home. I am painfully shy and awkward and have no friends. I've joined a few clubs to make friends but it seems impossible; people try to befriend me it seems, and I just don't know how to interact.  I had an amazing conversation with another top performer in my class with the difficult work and anticipated becoming friends- she tries, but I dont know how to reciprocate and I can tell that I make things uncomfortable because I react as if we never started forming a friendship, if that makes sense. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn my other class there is one kid who has tried to befriend me. He has autism and comes across pretty brash. I try to remind myself that he has a condition and to not take things personally, but sometimes I can't help it and I feel terrible and other times he is just too close and I feel awkward. I think he seems genuinely friendly and most of the time I dont mind him, but I guess I'm just under so much stress at this point that everything is getting to me. The whole class is also pretty distracting, which again, is usually bearable but the stress is wearing me out and there's 0 things I can do to relieve it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYesterday I got a grade back from a quiz and just a friendly note to try to speak up more during critique(I'm a design student, so this is an art class). I made a mental note to make sure to speak up during critique last night, and then I panicked. First I panicked because I wanted to be done my painting beforehand- I hadn't planned properly and am always the slow one in everything, so I kept messing up and didn't finish in time. It seemed I was one of 2 others who hadn't finished so that made me feel a little better. Critique came and the aforementioned kid stood next to me as he always does, uncomfortably close, and then in front of me and I couldn't see the paintings. Panic increased and I didn't want to be rude so I didn't say anything. I planned for what shouldve been my painting for critique and was called out of order and further panicked. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have a disorder that causes dissociation under stress and I have social anxiety. So when I panic, my mind goes blank. This happened a few days ago; my dog is unfortunately aggressive with 1 dog in my neighborhood. She is a strong dog and fortunately until this point, it had only been my bf who had experienced this. She lunged at the dog and I wasnt strong enough to pull her back, I panicked,mind went blank, and I just stood there. In my mind, the only thing i could think was like, the idea or feeling of alarm, but I couldn't speak or move. The neighbor didn't seem to mind and gave the dogs treats, but I felt so terrible. I don't know how to fix this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDuring the critique, my mind was blank and I didn't know what to say. I absorbed things others had said, but my mind flushed them out when I tried to speak. Speaking and thinking at the same time is difficult for me. I guess I'm just stupid. I usually think for a long time before I speak, and I can think and write, but I dont know how to think+speak quickly or at once. I just felt like crying and couldn't wait to just pack up and start on my drawing assignment(until I realized I'd forgotten my most important supplies).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI grew up with abusive parents. My dad was pretty absent, working a lot, but when he was home he was a complete ass. He would constantly provoke me. My older brother harshly picked on me. My mom did the most damage, somehow. I grew up thinking she was \"good cop\", she taught me to think that. She could do no wrong, she was perfect, she was always right. If she was upset with me, even if seemingly unreasonable, I did mental gymnastics with myself to justify it. Example: I didn't intervene in her argument with my dad over finances which 6 year old me didn't understand? I'm a bad person who doesn't love mom. \nMoms in the bathroom the 8th time this week with razor blades? I'd be her psychiatrist and beg her to come out,reason with her why she should. Eventually I realized I didn't have to say anything. Eventually still, I realized that I could probably leave because she would just come out soon anyway. I did once, around 6 or 7 and I guess she talked and I didn't respond, so she came literally running after me, cornered me, and yelled down at me for not loving her.\n&amp;nbsp;\nI have an eating disorder? \nI'm \"evil\", I'm a \"dirty slut\" even though I'm not allowed out of the house- this must be because of how I look or something I've done- am I that person? Mom says so, so i guess so. \n&amp;nbsp;\nAs a young child, I was mostly raised by my grandparents nextdoor and would sleep over at their house often. I'd cry myself to sleep every night because I thought my mom was mad at me. Every day, I'd be to blame for something. Once, I even got blamed for my dad losing $100. I don't even know why. My mom yelled from up at our back door to down at the yard at me, with the neighborhood kids all outside, telling me I'd better bring the $100 back right now. So then my friends assumed I was a thief(cause a 9 y/o who can't drive and never goes anywhere has a reason for money is definitely wont get caught with random money at some point \ud83d\ude44). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt some point, around 9, I started self harming because I didn't understand what I had apparently done. I was upset for always being such an apparent major cause of my mother's pain- the person I did love most in the world no matter what she thought.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy parents destroyed my education as an ongoing argument for the funsies I guess. I planned to graduate at 15 or 16 and GTFO. I was physically bullied at school to the point of having my arms near broken every day. I begged to be homeschooled- my plan was to be able to focus on my schooling without bullies and graduate early to get away from my family. I was in 2nd grade my first year homeschooling and skipped up to grade 5 work in everything but math, which I got up to maybe grade 3 which was equivalent to my current grade in public school work. My parents would argue about public and homeschooling and switch me back and forth at least once a school semester. So I'd be in public school in august for a few months, then homeschooled. Obviously this ruined my extra work I'd done and I became discouraged. In 7th grade, I began having a lot of trouble with math. My mom refused to help me, saying I had learning disability and just couldn't learn so to not do it(and then help my lovely, psychotic step sister instead). She'd do this to me at public school too, and I'd often go in humiliated having to explain that I couldn't finish my homework. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt one point, I wasn't allowed outside(my grandparents had moved in) and due to that and all the stress, I embraced being reclusive. I told myself I wanted to be that way and whenever people would think it was odd, my mom would huff back at them before I could speak, saying that not everyone has to have friends.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd now I'm this. Looking back, I remember my dad telling me that my mom coddled me too much and kept me from other people, wanting me all to herself. At the time I thought it was ridiculous, but now I see he was right; she needed me to soothe her, to blame for everything, to be there in misery with her. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI got older, decided that I wanted to try being social, so I'd say yes to every single opportunity. Every one. That was a terrible idea and I ended up being abused by a few predatory opportunists, which in turn caused me major anxiety, more than ever before, and I became more reclusive than ever before. I havent held a stable job in a while. Havent had friends since that time, about 10 years ago. I've been with my SO, who has been abusive off and on. Things were great for a few years until we moved out a few years ago, and now they've been very off and on. For a few years again, things have been pretty good as far as that goes, but obviously not having time and not feeling effort from the other person feels shitty too. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA couple years ago I found myself in a terrible situation with him and decided my options were prostitution, stripping, drugs, or suicide. I mass applied to jobs but when I'd receive a response, I was never qualified for anything but retail which I've had bad experiences with and it doesn't pay enough. I stopped eating, became an alcoholic with the little funds I had, and attempted suicide somewhere near 3 times a week on average for a few months straight. I almost succeeded once and then my bf unexpectedly came home early and I was sent to the hospital. Things didn't get better when I got out, I threw away my antidepressants since my feelings felt inappropriate in relation to my thoughts and situation, and resumed weekly attempts. Otherwise I'd just lie in bed and try not to get up for fear of killing myself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2017 and 2018 sucked. Last year got a little better and by the end of the year I decided to go back to school. I decided rather abruptly and didn't have time to seek diagnosis for learning disabilities, which I think I obviously have. I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorders and recurrent major depressive disorder but I've assumed I wouldn't receive any accommodations for those because.. what can be done?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nInstead I've tried plowing through my feelings and intentionally making myself uncomfortable by joining clubs and going to campus in person, but I'm not adjusting as quickly as I'd hoped. And in the real world, I will have to talk, I will have to have social skills. No one cares about you in the real world. I'm old and have already exposed myself to that in the many job fields I've attempted, so I'm aware. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI just feel like I'm a failure. And now I'm overloading myself and I dont want to back down, but idk how to deal with everything and get no help, and have nothing outside of school and working at home. I need a good balance, but I have literally no way of making that happen. I'm in a club that meets once a week, the paper which is 1x a month, and now a new club that no one showed up for, so I became club leader. This will force me into social situations, and I hope that I can do it. In my head I'm telling myself to just do it, so I try, and I talk, and garbage comes out. And I'm older than everyone else, so it's awkward. I'm not supposed to be so immature and stupid by social standards. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI feel like I'm just not going to make it. I have straight A's but I feel like I don't deserve them. My art never looks good to me even after spending hours working. I need to make this work but I dont know how. I dont know how to change who I've been for 29 years, in an instant, but I desperately want to. I want to be different, I dont want to be who I am anymore. In the meantime, I'm trying to squeeze in time with my SO and getting very little sleep. Most of it is just time in the same room not even interacting or talking or anything and I feel really void of any affection and social interaction right now, as well as anything fun. I used to walk every day- it's something that lessens the frequency of nerve pain and I dont even have time for that. The weather has been shit anyway. I dont find gaming fun, I don't like to sit, but that's all I'm doing. I'm exhausted. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI dont even know what I'm getting at anymore with this. I'm just frustrated with life. Everything is dull,I'm over stressed,lonely, and I honestly just hate myself. Everything about myself is awful, I really hate who I am. I became really sick in the first few weeks of school and have had bronchitis for about 3-4 weeks. It's getting better but I feel like that happening really fucked a lot up for me since I had no energy. I dont know how to manage everything or how to socialize. I feel like I should just kill myself but I dont know how to even do it properly in a way that wont be totally awful. I'm looking to get away from pain and if the last minutes of my life could at least be peaceful that would be, well, ideal. I really wish assisted suicide for chronically suicidal people was a thing sometimes.\nAs a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

She will think it\u2019s her fault, similar to how she took my sisters anxiety problem, and I can\u2019t burden that on her.

Went to liberal arts college in another state has manic/psychotic episodes had to go back home. Started community college but parents pulled me out during my depressive episode.\n\n- No trust in men. I can never have a normal relationship. Besides being raped, I had men bombard me with videos of porn stars and detail why I wasn\u2019t as hot as them, inspect me for flaws, take advantage of my past trauma as part of their kink, lie to me about being married, tell me that the only reason they like me is because I\u2019m psycho or dumb, etc. I shouldn\u2019t have been dating during this bad time. During my Klonopin withdrawal period, I had a panic attack and a guy just drove away.\n\n- OCD thoughts nonstop. I\u2019m scared of even thinking certain thoughts. I\u2019m convinced certain thoughts or not having certainty thoughts will jinx my future. I\u2019m scared I\u2019m a sexual deviant (even though I have no libido and am a straight vanilla female with only 2 sexual partners ever 3 including rape). I\u2019m convinced I\u2019m becoming a hermaphrodite, or that I\u2019m actually transgender. Weird thoughts.\n\n- Eating disorder. Scared of being fat, also scared of being skinny. I just want to look ill. I don\u2019t want to look like a girl that men fetishize. Look small and thin and pedophiles will want to rape me. Look curvy and I\u2019ll be objectified. I can\u2019t stop bingeing and purging. I was underweight then a guy was checking me out now I want to become fat.\n\n- Mom harassed me for my nude photos. She imitated how I took the photos, this is what drove me to attempt suicide. She showed them to my dad and sister and now everyone thinks I\u2019m a slut and my sister tells my cousin about how I sleep with many men on the first date. \n\n- Blatant preferential treatment for my sister. She gets her laptop fixed, I don\u2019t. She gets haircuts, I don\u2019t. While I was getting a seizure from Klonopin withdrawals, my mom was shopping for a custom coat for my sister for hours and when I told my mom what happened she said something like \u201coh that\u2019s not nice.\u201d\n\n- Hundreds of people know my diagnosis and think I\u2019m crazy. My sister had a fundraiser for mental illness to help her get into a good college and to make it more inspirational she shared my health information with many people who now treat me weird.\n\n- Everyone outside our family like extended family and family friends also are super patronizing and treat me as this person you want to be cordial with but also not get close to and are super patronizing \n\nI need someone to talk to so badly. I\u2019ve felt this way for so so so long. No one cares. I feel invisible. I swear I can tell aloud that I want to kill my self and no one would care. I wish someone could ask me if I\u2019m ok. I\u2019ve asked other people so many times if they\u2019re ok can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve been asked that. I\u2019m so selfish I hate it\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question. Does this person suffer from suicidal potential or depression? '.

It was something out of our control and I don\u2019t blame her or hate her for it, but it meant upending my life and moving 300 miles away and back in with my parents after 7 years of being in my relationship and being independent. I left my life and my cats behind, they were basically holding me together at the time. I lost my job in September and have had a really hard time finding work. So as you can imagine I\u2019m feeling pretty low right now. \n\nThe main issue: my mother and I have never really gotten along. She\u2019s unpleasant to be around for long periods of time. Fine in small doses though. She basically shits on everything I do or try to do. There\u2019s always something negative that she brings to the equation that takes the wind out of my sails. \n\nI went for a job interview last week, it went okay. Wasn\u2019t great, wasn\u2019t terrible. I was confident that I was on the border of getting it. I got the rejection email this afternoon. It felt like I got kicked in the stomach by a shire horse. It was an awful feeling being knocked back. I applied for 43 jobs and that was my only interview and I didn\u2019t get it. I was feeling pretty bad, then my mum came in to the room. She decided now was a good time to ask \u201cwhat would you do if you didn\u2019t have me and your dad to feed you and keep you?\u201d A pleasant topic of conversation. I said, \u201cwell, I\u2019d be homeless and sleeping rough I\u2019d imagine mum.\u201d She didn\u2019t seem satisfied by this response and decided to go on a tirade about how I should seek unemployment benefits and such. Which I would, but my last ounce of pride won\u2019t let me. I should also mention that I haven\u2019t asked for a penny of charity from her since I got back. Anything she and my dad have paid for is listed on my phone and I fully intend on paying her back when I\u2019m working or have some money coming in. I haven\u2019t loaned money from my mum since I was at uni. Not because I didn\u2019t need the help, I just couldn\u2019t handle the arguing anymore. My sister however, currently owes my mum and dad thousands and they don\u2019t chase her for it. Whenever she needs help they drop what they are doing to help her. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just bitter about that because my mum makes the statement \u201cwe treat you both the same\u201d all the time, but I know they don\u2019t. \n\nShe continued to twist the knife until I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and just walked out of the room. \n\nI should say, that she doesn\u2019t seem to mind having me around when a delivery is coming and she wants to go and see a friend, or when I make lunch and dinner, or when I do housework. I feel like a should help out around the house where I can. Most of the time it\u2019s not good enough for her, but at least I tried. \n\nAfter all of this I\u2019m just left with this feeling of uselessness and that I\u2019ll never be good enough. Maybe I\u2019m being over sensitive with how much is going on (my ex and I broke up last month, so not that long ago). I don\u2019t know.

However in middle school, I've experienced trauma that changed me forever and left a very deep scar on me emotionally that took me years to overcome because no one tried to help, those who see me went through it and those who I spoke to about it didn't try to help. For years I had trust issues and was paranoid most of the time, it was my first experience of feeling alone and that no one understands me, and slowly I started to drift away and shut myself out, I just wanted to be alone and because of that I started to lose friends but I didn't care at that time, I thought I was doing the right thing by avoiding as much social interaction as possible. I guess in a way I was trying to protect myself.\n\nThe years after that, I've tried to regain my social life back and make friends again, I tried everything that I can from trying to act as a happy and funny person cause no one wants to see the real me, my depressing and sad self who wants to make friends with such a person? and when it actually works out, I thought I was doing the right thing but it ends up making me more depressed cause it takes me a lot of effort to be \"that person\" and I really didn't felt like I'm making any deep connection with anyone so I was like screw it, I'll just be myself by which I mean that I will not try anything to be forcefully liked by others and I thought since I'm into so many things, I will probably find someone who is into one of these things and be friends with but that didn't work out either. I kinda became that extra friend in a group that her existence or not didn't make any difference or that friend who you come to when your other friends are not around or that person you hang out not because you enjoy their company but you just don't want to be sitting alone. That messed me up in my senior year of high school, I felt like shit and I spent most of the time during the break in the toilet cause I rather that than feeling like shit when I am with others. And just to be clear, they are not awful people and they didn't say anything bad to me, it's just I've been friends with them for so long and whether at that time when I was trying to be the funny and happy person or myself, either way, I never felt I belong or that anyone cared, I felt I was just someone they knew and sure why not they can call a \"friend\".\n\nIn college though is where my struggle peaked, all those friendships that I made in high school are slowly disappearing everyone was moving on with their lives and I guess that means leaving unwanted relationships behind but regardless I did what I thought was right and did my part. I've reached out to them but it always ends up a one-sided relationship with everyone apparently and no one will reach out to me if I don't so I stopped. There was this one person I was close to during my school years and I tried to be the friend she can rely on in time of needs and depend on, I wanted to be always there for her but she never makes time for me but somehow she can with others so I tried to put \"our friendship\" to the test and just respond coldly to her messages just to see if she will ask what's wrong, I want her to notice that there was a problem and see if she gonna care about our friendship but she ends up unfollowing me in social media and blocked me out of her life that simply even though she perfectly knows me too well and knows that this is not my kind of behavior.\n\nI had no problem talking with strangers, I can open a conversation and interact with anyone easily so trying to get to know people in college was not difficult except I don't think anyone wanted to be my friend, I just remain their classmate. I end up making just one friend in college, we had a lot in common and I really believed it could work out but it took a lot of ignoring of her frustrating attitude which sometimes makes me wonder if she will bother to hold on to me if I ever show my frustration. At some point, I've gone through a deep depression that made me very suicidal and thought there was no future for me but I was trying to hold on to hope and as much I want to act tough and act like I can handle this I couldn't, I really just need someone to talk to and so far as you can see I had no one except this college friend and I didn't know how it will go but thought let's give it a try so I opened up to her and after when I was done, the conversation didn't last for 2 minutes and I was so crushed because sure maybe she was not the perfect person to open up to but at that time I didn't have any option and I just really needed someone in my life to talk to. I really thought I'm gonna do it on that day cause I really lost hope.\n\nAs of now, it feels like I'm back at the starting point. I probably sound very awfully pathetic person or stupid to you. Every time when I'm not able to maintain any relationship in my life, I asked myself what's wrong with me? what have I done wrong in my life? I realized after a while that I try to fix things so hard in my life that I end up breaking it or damaging it but I always thought I was doing the right thing and doing my part by reaching out or helping out but somehow it doesn't make things better. It always seems that I'm the one making the effort and if you didn't notice, throughout those stages of my life that I mentioned no one tried to be my friend or wanted to but I've always seemed to be the one who wants to be someone's friend. Right now, I'm very much confused about what exactly I'm supposed to do. I just don't understand why I'm struggling so much to find somewhere I belong, I feel very much rejected no matter what I do. If I make an effort or not I end up alone either way. Everyone in my life seems to give up on me and no one bothers to hold on to me. I just don't know if I'm supposed to give up and just accept the fact that maybe this is how things supposed to be in my life.\n\nI tried not to bore you guys with the details and complicate stuff, I hope my situation was made clear and it wasn't confusing. I just really need some advice cause I don't think I'm going to find a good one from my mind.

I\u2019ve dealt with depression since Highschool, and I thought I got better for...I was doing great, went to college, got a job...But recently my anxiety has gotten really bad again...I dated this girl for a little over a year, then I felt myself slipping back into that depression (it was a long distance relationship, I\u2019m in Cali, and she\u2019s back home across the country) anyway...I started getting bored I guess with the relationship because it was just like being in a relationship with facetime...We would try to meet up every now and then...But maybe saw each other about 3 to 4 times a year, and the distance just got in the way, and we decided mutually to sorta break it off. We would still FaceTime everyday, we\u2019d pick a movie to watch together and it was just like we were dating still, but I couldn\u2019t tell her I love her anymore. And that\u2019s when my depression started coming back...Well, fast forward a few months, it\u2019s Christmas I\u2019m home, and she spends my whole first day with me and my family. We wound up sleeping together that night, then the next day she has to leave because she has a job in a different state...We talked about what had happened, and she said it didn\u2019t mean anything. And I thought we were going to get back together again. But that never happened. Now, more recently...She started telling me about this other guy she\u2019s dating, and I try to be supportive she\u2019s moving on, so why can\u2019t I? All I can think about is them together, and him making her happier than me, like I wasn\u2019t good enough for her, but if she\u2019s happy with another guy then why do I want her to be unhappy with me? And I just keep having this one thought of them sleeping together. And that won\u2019t get out of my mind. It\u2019s all I think about every time she tells me they\u2019re hanging out. The thoughts don\u2019t stop, so I drink, and when I drink I cut, and I don\u2019t wanna cut anymore so I stopped drinking, and started scratching my fingers to the point it bleeds and scabs over, and it\u2019s only when I get panic attacks, but I get panic attacks every time I think about her, because when I think about her I think about him, and when I do that I see them \u201ctogether\u201d and what if he\u2019s better than? This is dumb I know because we broke up, but she\u2019ll still call me when she gets off work, or answer when I call her, but she just tells me about the guy, or she could just be talking about anything...But I just see them, and we hang up, and I want to cut, but I don\u2019t. I haven\u2019t cut in about two weeks now, and it\u2019s hard to get over her. Everyone has the one they let get away, and that was mine, and now I just regret not being there for her enough, I don\u2019t know what else I could\u2019ve done though, I only get so much vacation days, and I\u2019m sorta broke all the time...And I want to do something for her but I can\u2019t I just feel so alone and worthless all the time. I keep obsessing over the two of them together, and I just trigger my own panic attacks and I hate this. I wouldn\u2019t actually commit suicide, but the thoughts have started surfacing again...And I know it\u2019s not that I want to die, I just want not to feel this way, and I know it\u2019ll happen in time, but these past few weeks I\u2019ve stopped eating, I\u2019ve stopped sleeping, I just have trouble focusing on things I\u2019m smoking waaay more than I normally do, and I just need help. I can\u2019t get obsessing over this. \n\n\n\nSorry this is so long, I just don\u2019t really have anyone to talk to, and figured I\u2019d just vent everything in front of strangers\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

Because my parents this is happening because of some sort of supernatural evil thing. After diagnosis they didn't took me to therapy ever again. Rather they took me to get rid of that evil thing. I'm not gonna be able to to study and waste all their money again. They also have to give dowry for my marriage and pay for my education. And waste my life, and their money. We have financial problems too.\n\nI think it's justified to commit suicide.\n\nBut what if ruin their mental health.\n\nMy mom had BPD, and schizophrenia. My sister is 10. I think this will ruin their life. But we aren't close emotionally. They might also be better without me.\n\nMy reality is mess, I think I can never recover, and waste my life, and live like this for 60 years, which is so scary. My mom doesn't go to a doctor because she thinks this is because of that evil thing. I'm scared for her. She doesn't eat because she thinks her enemy is gonna kill her if she does so. No matter how much we insist to take her to a doctor, she refused.\n\nI'm stuck.\n\nI'm scared of all the suffering there are in the world. I've seen street dogs die because of road accident, and there's no one to even take care of the dead body. His hide was there at the road. \n\nPlease don't say not to commit suicide, just because of your moral obligation. Please answer if my family would be better without me. \n\nIf you took your time to read all this, I can't thank you enough.\nAs a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

Really badly. I don't wan't to cause the people that somehow still love me this pain, they need me here. But I am just so tired, so fucking tired.  I'm tired of this sad, mean, world. I feel like I can succeed, but I don't see the point if I still will not be happy. On the other hand I get the point, try to make family happy, and spend the little time we have with the ones we love. Someone of you may say, \"at least you are lucky you have people that love you this much\", and that is true. If it wasn't for them, I would not be here a long time ago. However, perhaps the feeling that brings within me the most pain and sorrow is: what if that love is not reciprocated? Don't get me wrong, I love these people. But I don't love spending time with anyone. I don't even love spending time by myself. I don't know what I want or what will make my day better. The thought of going through the same cycles of just trying to find some little piece of happy in the day for me and my loved ones for the rest of my life makes me not want to live through it. I find the bad in every activity, see the negative flaw of every person, while at the same time try to keep 'face' as much as possible. I think I can summarize this feeling into: I feel guilty for the pain that I cause my loved ones, but at the same time I am so fucking selfish. I just can't take it anymore. I feel like I am loosing my shit, I don't even know if I am depressed, crazy, bipolar, i don;t know. It just hurts. I want it to stop. \\*I wanted better for myself\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, I don't know why I am writing this. \n\nI don't even want any help or input{\n\nI just want this sadness to go way, I can't go around another day with my head down and my eyes filled with tears. I just feel like I wasn't born to act like this, I wanted to be strong physically and mentally in order to provide for my loved ones, not tear them down with my negativity. \n\neveryone problem is bigger than mine. I am just a selfish bitch who is too much of a pussy to deal with his own fucking emotions. There are people in this world who have gotten a much shittier hand. yet here i am fucking wanting to die. how does this make any sense?\n\nIt's also really hard to hide being so fucking sad; I am 6'6, live with my loving girlfriend, and trying to be social in years when I still had hope means there are still people who think I want friends in my life that try to reach out once in a while. Only to receive an excuse/ insult/ rambling when I try to avoid them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo matter how much effort I put into happiness, I can't seem to get close without cheating. Sure, some things make me happy, but as soon as they do, my mind almost tries to find the negative in the situation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo end this shit, I wanna make a wish.   \nI wish for the kids who have to be strong, to have bull sized balls, and help every person in need. \n\nBecause the false sense of protection is the last thing that they need. \n\nIf you can't do it, don't say you can. Because when you don't, or aren't here, they will stay behind wondering why you every left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStay strong everyone, \n\nI am ok with being weak, I already have been for years.

If you want to have a conversation, I\u2019m here for it, otherwise nothing to see here haha.\n\nI\u2019ve been so low the past couple weeks I haven\u2019t felt like myself at all. I\u2019ve felt a fair amount of that apathy I read about on this sub often, and it\u2019s scary.\n\nI know the things I need to do in order to overcome this depression - the tools I can reach for. Exercise, nutrition, therapy, group therapy, being open with friends and family, volunteering, strong social connections, medical health, and on and on. The laundry list is long and tough to grapple with all at once. But having a couple of weeks of pure hell makes me realize that I\u2019m really not working on any one of those things strongly. \n\nWhat have I done to really move forward in the last year? I feel like I haven\u2019t really reached for any of those huge steps since I started therapy in 2015. I\u2019ve been going for over four years, and it\u2019s been life-changing, but what other healthy steps have I taken? \n\nLast summer my dental health became overwhelming, something I must take care of. I went back for my first appointment in years. Gradually I took care of my pain and the rot in my mouth was alleviated. I lost a tooth in the process but a huge weight was lifted as well. \n\nI need some similar weight lifted now, but most of all I want to be able to reach for it. I crave some discipline; the dental work came as a result of time running out as it were, reactive not proactive. I want to be strong enough to work thru this shit at a healthy pace, not leave things go awry for months on end, until a consequence happens. But I suppose in order to get there I have to first admit that I AM weak and I DO need help. I can\u2019t do it all on my own like I tell myself I must. \n\nI\u2019d really like to get an exercise bike. I can see all the positives: cardio health/body positivity/motivation to hike more/overall getting in shape. For someone healthy, buying a bike (putting in the research, going to stores, asking people for advice) would be doable. Simple tasks like that are fucking hard for me because I\u2019m not healthy.\n\nSo how do I get there? Ask my sister to take me shopping one day? This post is a good start: question why I\u2019ve failed in the past and talk through the doable steps, remind myself of the positive outcomes in working thru it. Maybe I need to meditate again: breathe thru the pressure in my chest when I think about going to a bike store or talking to people on Craigslist. \n\nI wish I could work thru these things easily like a normal person. I guess my win today is admitting I\u2019m broken and depression is at fault. Maybe if I admit that more often I\u2019ll see it\u2019s ok to ask for help and beat myself up less.\n\nI\u2019ve never really lost love for myself because I know I\u2019m a good man. My therapist told me that purpose can be looked at as two halves: BEing and DOing. Right now I\u2019m happy with my self-philosophy and who I am when I\u2019m NOT depressed. That person is good. It\u2019s time to accept that I\u2019m not healthy enough to DO good yet. At least not to the degree that I hope my future holds. It\u2019s hard to reconcile how much depression is holding me back. I hope I can look myself in the mirror this deeply in the next little while and reach for more of that help that I need to pick myself up off the ground. Maybe it can start with the exercise bike.\nAs a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question. Determine whether this person is depressed or wants to suicide? '.

I just turned 25, I\u2019m a girl from the US who is disabled (I have depression, BPD, anxiety, ADD and I have bad tremors as a result of these issues) and my parents treat me like I\u2019m a little girl. I have not worked a proper job very much in my life and I\u2019m a little immature for my age. \n\nBasically, where I am now, I feel mentally and physically unwell to work - the tremors go in and out and I collapse of exhaustion at least twice a month from them. My parents, my mum especially- are pressuring me to work, she gives me jobs I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle and I apply to them to make her happy, though I never hear back. She is a social worker and when I say I\u2019m too unwell to work she goes *\u201dI\u2019ve worked with people with Down\u2019s syndrome, who were severely disabled, they had jobs.\u201d* or *\u201dI worked with a schizophrenic woman once, that\u2019s worse than what you have, and she held down a 9 to 5 job.\u201d* and so fourth. I think I should be on disability but my mum sees that as \u201cgiving up\u201d and says that they won\u2019t accept me because I \u201chaven\u2019t showed signs of trying\u201d IE my small work history - the majority of money I\u2019ve made over the years is from my music, but that comes few and far between.\nBecause I don\u2019t have a job, my mum makes it my \u201cjob\u201d in the house to be the only person who ever cleans our cats\u2019 litter box, and when my tremors are going this is bad because I can\u2019t hold the bag straight and I get litter and cat droppings everywhere, but she\u2019s so insistent on sticking it to me that I\u2019m not working that this doesn\u2019t matter. \nI Have two girlfriends, my parents only know I\u2019m dating one of them. One lives in Canada, I have wanted to run away there but my mum said if I even tried to visit her she would get Canadian police to come get me since I\u2019m mentally unwell (my Canadian girlfriend also struggles with that and my parents like her but says she\u2019s a \u201cbasket case\u201d and that I shouldn\u2019t  date her) but I  kinda don\u2019t have a passport anyway.\n\nMy other girlfriend lives in the Midwest US and my mum says if I moved there I\u2019d never contact the family ever again even though I told her I would, and that I would become ungrateful towards my girlfriend and get an \u201cattitude\u201d with her - my parents say I have a short temper but I\u2019m quite mellow, it\u2019s just that years of verbal abuse from my father - who to his credit is finally doing something about this - has gotten me very damaged.\n\n\nAnyways, I like tried to stab myself in the stomach but was stopped and the knife was taken from me. I feel  stuck, and I really want to keep going but it\u2019s getting really difficult. I don\u2019t want to break my girlfriends\u2019 hearts. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.

When I actually started studying I started to get grades in the 90s and even some at 100%. Even though I skimmed through with exemplary grades, I barely retained any of what I learned.

So, here is the post.\n\nI will frame unnecessary explanations with \"//\", in case anyone reading wants to skip. Although I'd like to warn you that this post is somewhat long regardless, as I like to explain things.\n\nI've been considering myself unworthy (of a real friend, of feeling better, of complaining) since a long time, as I have a nice life, or because that I'm not feeling as bad as many other people who are said to be depressed. I obviously never wanted to be sad, nor to experience bad things, but I wanted to be worthy of some certain things I felt I needed. Over time I began feeling worse and worse, to a point where I compare myself more than I used to do, where almost everything upsets me. \n\n//For example, let's say there is a character I relate to and am happy about being alike. That used to be a source of motivation. Now when I see this character, I can only think of how much better this said persona is compared to myself, and how I can never be like them. When I look at something I value, rather than being happy I feel worried of what might happen to them. Or, when entering a new season I mourn the previous, alongside all the time I wasted.//\n\nI'm mostly worried, stressed, or sad. The thing is that there is no clear reason for me to feel so. I sometimes question if I myself feel that way..\n\n\n\nI also am having a hard time figuring my feelings for over a year. There are some occasions where I thought I didn't feel anything, but couldn't help crying.\n\nThe reason I'm writing this post is that, while watching a show, a character explained a 'negative' habit of the other, which I ultimately related to. It's not something I consider to be really bad. However, after that scene I couldn't somehow focus to the episode. My interest faded to a point. It was almost as if I was reacting to what was said, but I don't even care that much. The character cared, but not me. Was I impersonating his emotions? Or am I just faking all these to feel worthy? I cannot understand this. Am I really sad or am I just kidding myself?\n\nI can barely read my own feelings, beliefs, and thoughts at this point. Like, I still know what they are, but I can't feel that. Not always, but mostly it's like a colourless, pitcureless page of information. \"I feel this, I think that.\" but, do I really?

I don't want medication but I self medicate with alcohol, work obsession or high risk sports. I'm embarrassed because I can't fit in with life, I'm broken with no fix. I suffer in silence as I don't want to bother my family, friends and girlfriend. I have planned my suicide many times, even tonight.

I already go through cycles of being numb, angry, and sad. I don't want to feel numb from medication (I've been there before, what is the purpose.). I don't trust anyone to talk about this with, they respond with ways that make me hide my what I truly feel.\n\nI want this pain to stop, the pain I've been feeling for years. Why am I broken? Besides not waking up, I don't know what else is the answer. I understand why my family member committed suicide, I get it, it isn't selfish, it is to stop the pain that many can't understand.\n\nI don't know what to do. Do I end it, hide in silence and keep everyone happy, or say something and be even more miserable and in turn become more numb? Who really cares? I know alcohol doesn't help, but it helps me sleep, or if I don't drink here I am wide awake trying to make my brain quiet. I do high risk sports, secretly hoping that I will die.\n\nI spent last night at the emergency room alone, I didn't contact my family, friends and erased a message for my girlfriend (I wasn't sure if it was a heart attack and didn't want to die alone but didn't want to bother anyone). My girlfriend saw some erased messages, so I told my girlfriend that it was some chest pain I wanted to make sure wasn't anything, I never told my family or friends and never will.\n\nI don't know what to do, I need this to stop. This is my cycle, I'm numb or angry at everyone and push everyone way. If I wake up tomorrow, I will think whoever wrote this is an idiot and stupid, numb and ignorant to the pain I feel.

But it wouldn't jump. So I had to spend money to get it towed. Then the damn mechanic shop jerked me around, and ended up fighting with them alot ( I use to be a mechanic so I know when I'm getting jerked around) but they were so incompetent, that it took them 6 hours to basically figure out that the battery needed to be replaced and then do it. They lied to me when they told me the tested the battery when they first pulled it in the bay. They put a new starter on, without telling me until after the fact. And then told me my engine was seized up due to there being 0 oil in it. Which I dont know if I believe, because I just got my oil changed about a week and a half ago. And I know I dont have a leak.

The littlest things can set me off. I'm always hurting peoples feelings with jokes I make, then I always say \"Don't be so sensitive\" when I know for sure it was MY fault they got offended. It's hard for me to take responsibility.\n\nI also feel very alone, and I don't mean the sense of friendships. I'm talking about romantic relationships. I've had about 4 or 5 concussions, and I say that because I know I've definitely had some that weren't diagnosed as I used to box. It's just really hard for me to say what I want to say. I fumble my words a lot, and I noticed that after my most recent concussion about a month ago.\n\nFor example, one thing I said that I regret was calling a girl a \"dyke\" because she said something rude to me. What I said was so uncalled for, especially since I knew she was bisexual. I feel like trash because I don't say things like this (homophobic) all the time per-say, but that is just an example of how offensive and unregulated the stuff that comes out of my mouth on the daily.\n\nI constantly have to be high on marijuana most of the time to keep my mood up and I don't want to be like that. The weed just makes things worse for me when I'm not high because I get even more irritable then I was before I smoked and I go through bad anxiety and psychosis episodes.\n\nI also feel like a failure. I am in my senior year of high school and I feel hopeless. My grades are all F's and I don't know what to do anymore. I plan on going to trade school after this year but I probably won't follow through on that because I never follow through on anything I want to do,  as my anxiety prevents me from doing lots of stuff.\n\nI think about suicide but the thought scares me and it's just and endless cycle of just that and it sends me down a dark hole in my thoughts. I feel hopeless like nothing can help me anymore.\n\nAlso, I don't want to sound pathetic but its what I am. I told the girl I like that I liked her. She said doesn't reciprocate those feelings but it hurt when she said she liked me 2 years prior. It especially hurt because I liked her back then as well. Once again my anxiety prevents me from being happy and thats all I want, is too be happy again.

I'm sorry for taking your time, but I need help. \n\nA bit of a back story to my life: I come from a not-so-well-off family, mom left me (9at the time) and my sister (14 at the time)in my father's care (she left the country), to earn more so we could at least have a bread on the table. My sister took her frustrations on me, was being bullied at school gor not having a functional family, my father distanced himself from us... life generally sucked. I was also getting (at the time undiagnosed) migraines, which my sis and dad kept insisting that I'm lying about for attention, was even punished for it. So I stoped talking. After a long 2 years, my mother had applied for divorce, mainly due to my father's threats and mental abuse. By what I saw, my father was threatening my mother to throw me and my sis in the streets if she didn't send more money. The divorce was messy and a lot of shit throwing at eachother. It ended with my sis insisting that we need to stick toghether and since she was older, she insisted that we stay in my home country with my dad, also to spite my mother, who she now hated. The next years were rough, a lot of screaming, bullying, hitting, starving... list is long. (Just on a side note, I ended up climbing trees from windows to grab aome nasty fruit for my class mates and trading them and homework for sandwiches. Did I care I was millimeters away from dying, NAH!) Highschool was worse with the bulying, mom was still away but now, she had someone (she met the guy before the divorce, but I can't blame her. She was alone in a country where my people were, and still are, very hated). We tried to get mom to get cuatody of me, but for reasons I still can't wrap my head around, it failed. Well, her (now) husband lost his crap, and kept repeating to me and making me feel like pure shit because the process failed. It did fail because of me, yes, but as I said previously, I still don't remember why I said what I said and what happened. Years later, they decide to go to a better place, Australia! After 4 years of struggles and 3 lost cases, I finally get to get my (20 y/o) ass there with my mother. I get a boyfriend, her husband turns out to be the dickhead of the year and, long story short, I get kicked out of the house after only 1 year living with them, and end up with extremely severe anxiety because of him.\n\nThis year I turned 24. I still live with my boyfriend, who took me in. But here is where the problem is. I want to end it. So much stuff is going on, and all I can say is that it's too much. I was diagnosed (discovered by accident) with clinical depression at the age of 16, and was never addressed. I always felt like something was wrong, but every time I tried to look for help, was told to suck it up by the counselors and psycologists (admittedly, I only worked the courage to go 3 times in my life).\n\nBut in the past 3 years, I felt lost. I've been depressed and can't seem to get over it. I find no joy in life or any of the things I used to love. I have no reason, energy or motivation to move on. I drive to work, I work, put a fake smile, drive back, sleep, agrue, sleep, repeat. I feel so angry all the time, I ended hating myself more than ever, and I don't know why! I feel my partner is not there, he's stuck in his games and not engaging, and I think this is because I put too much pressure on him. I can't see my mother to talk to her, my sister doesn't talk to me and I had to go full no contact with my father. And whenever anyone asks me how I am, all I can do is repeat \"I'm fine\" and smile. I hate it... I hate it all....\n\nSorry for putting this all out, but I had enough of this. I want to smile, to enjoy things, but I can't... I need help. I knew I had to write this after I watched some reddit reading and was crying like an idiot at how accurate and true the things said in said reading were (the topic was \"What do you wish more people knew about depression\")\n\nOnce again, I'm sorry for taking your time, but if you read it all, thank you. Thank you so much for listening.\n\nAlso, dear moderators, if this is not in accordince to the rules, please do delete it.

I don't know who to talk to and don't really have anyone to talk to so I just want to dump everything here and maybe get some guidance before I do something to make the pain go away. I never see my parents due to my mom and step dad being too busy with work and running a business and my dad is probably somewhere rotting in Arizona. My sister is deployed in the navy and the other ran away a few years ago and haven't heard from her, and my older brother is a drug addict that cut ties with us a long time ago. \n\nI don't want to message a suicide hotline out of fear they will send an ambulance or force me into a hospital forcing bills on me that I can not afford, and I have no one close to talk to about it. My situation is, growing up my parents both lived in different bad areas with little money. I was never smart or talented at anything besides having an over active imagination. I always had a learning issue both with paying attention and remembering information regardless of how hard I tried. Didn't have a lot of friends and ended up dropping out of high school. About 3 years ago I went back and got my Adult Diploma with the hopes it would be enough to get me on my feet. I'm now almost 26 and just a few months ago after I saw someone about my mental health I found out I have ADD. So some things where answered there, but it didn't help much. \n\nThe small amount of friends that I have, have become aware of my increasing depressed emotions and have tried to help but for the most part, they seem to pay no mind to it. I've working dead end jobs for most of my adult life until recently when I took a boot camp course in the Information Technology field. I then interned for 5 weeks and after got a position working for a small company as an IT help desk technician under a 3 month to perm contract. Or that's what they told me during the interview. I never did anything IT related and the contract was constantly extend by 3 months until my 9th month there. In that time, I've worked for some bad companies, but I have never worked somewhere that treated there (specifically the US employees) so poorly. They then after promising to increase my pay hired me on full time as salary, and cut my pay thinking I wouldn't notice. I then secretly started looking for new positions starting last July until November of last year when I was tired of they way they have treated me for over a year and without thinking, just left, even though I have monthly bills. \n\nOn top of the learning problems, I also have extreme anger problems and am very VERY impatient. As far as work goes, I have applied to countless IT positions since last July, with professional help updating resumes and cover letters, and re learning (trying to) as much IT knowledge as I can after using pretty much none of it at my last job and forgetting almost all of it, but I've gotten nothing. I have had 2 companies interview me and reject me after the 2nd or 3rd interview, and all of the other countless companies I've applied to have either flat out rejected me or have not said anything. I have next to nothing left with money and if I don't find something soon, I will lose everything and I can only imagine how bad my credit will be and the law suits to follow. Other than job things, I have never been in a real relationship, I never see my family even though I literally live with my mom and step dad, I almost never see my friends, I have an extreme hate for people I'm assuming due to everything I've had to go through over the years, and every day I spend hours trying to teach myself new things and applying for any position available that could possible help me with my situation, but since the last interview rejection and the constant no reply and email rejections, I can't anymore. \n\nI've tried so hard to make things better for myself, seeking medical help, close support from family and friends, and will power, but it's always one step forward and then being launched back. I'm tired of starting over, I'm tired of only knowing rejection and being ignored not just from jobs but from everything. I have become so angry and hate filled that I can't see happiness in anything. I used to love movies and video games and can't find joy in those. The only piece of escape I have day to day is music, because it almost thinks for me. I'm listening to it but I feel like it's also listening to me, feeling my constant pain and emotional wreck. Everyone says it will get better, but I've been at this for so long and it only keeps getting worse. I have put the effort in but it's like some deity is purposefully trying to prevent me from being happy or making myself successful, and over the past few weeks, I can't stop thinking of killing myself. Making this awful pain go away and not feeling anything anymore. The only thing that holds me back is the thought of what comes after. Possible non existence which I can't even comprehend. Just not knowing is the only thing holding me back, but even that fear is starting to go away and taking an early exit seems more and more like the best option.\n\nI apologize for the extremely long post, maybe just a way to leave a small mark on existence to make myself feel a little better. I don't seem myself feeling any better even if my hard work eventually gets me anywhere, a family, a job that actually pays enough for me to live on my own, not constantly worrying if I have enough for food and water or if I have to cut that out to make my payments. It's hard to feel happy or accomplished when all you know is failure and loss. There is more but I feel like I've said enough if anyone even reads this. I've re read this and gone over it a few times and I just keep feeling worse and adding more to it.

In the other hand, I was (and I am) really smart, but I don't really qualify myself about something special, because people are so stupid to think about being self-centered, instead of thinking about the personality itself, that's maybe one of the thing I don't even comprehend about society, well I continue, being able to do whatever you want its something amazing, I felt (I feel) I got the most powerful superpower, being able to think about something interesting to do and make it real, make it like I was professional on something, but if you can't even talk, even express yourself, your brain, all of your amazing ideas are taking down to trash, to something miserable, how much kids, teens worried about the things other people say (I worry too), but I'm 100% sure they can shine if they are with the correct people, ask me, I'm 22 now, in 22 years, Why didn't I find anyone like me?, anyone who I can talk about interesting things and not about superficial and stupid things, anyone who takes the life like a poetry, with right values, anyone who understands me, anyone who I can be myself\n\nI hated my school partners, and they always thought about things on how to ruin my day, I didn't understand why being so small, being so tiny they were so disrespectful to each other, I lived on a city that I can't even pronounce it's name because is the reason of all my misfortunes, people so damn vulgar, so damn low they can't even teach their kids how to be kind, how to be respectful to anyone. I learn about pride, that keep me away from bullying, they don't even know why they bullied me, bullies tend to attack people about their body, about if they are stupid, about a condition, they just attack me because it was me, and I know, they smell it like dogs, possessed maybe, because I didn't find a reasonable reason to understand what they bullied me, but in the middle of that, I thought why just can't we be friends? Why do we attack to each other? Only because I can't be vulgar like you?

I feel so selfish writing this. My parents refuse to get me tested for depression, So i can\u2019t say that I have it. I am ugly. No one wants to talk to me because i\u2019m not cool enough. If they are seen with me theyre automatically labeled as un-cool. I hate everyone. theyre so fucking selfish and fake. To me it hurts more to be rejected by a potential friend than a potential girlfriend. The only friends I have see that i\u2019m sad or im not motivated, and they try and force me to open up, and when they finally force me to they try to become my therapist. Then I become a burden to them and they feel the need to check up on me. And then they use my problems against me if I make them mad. I am so fucking selfish and everyone lies to me. Recently one of my only friends, a girl, i fell in love with, backstabbed me. She had been for many months now. I confessed my love for her 7 months ago and we\u2019ve been \u201cmore than friends\u201d for a while.. I realized that she only did this because she felt bad for me. She leaked my affectionate love notes and my personal problems to my only friends, who then laughed at me, called me a simp and stopped talking to me. I\u2019m too affectionate with people. My past relationships have always failed because i\u2019m not a strong independent man. I\u2019m a needy baby when it comes to the relationship and no girl wants a needy baby let alone an ugly fuck like me. I see girls at my school who look exactly like the girl who backstabbed me and it fucking eats me away inside knowing I have no chance. I want out. I just want to press escape and quit. I\u2019m too scared to jump off a building and I only would feel comfortable with a gun. But I don\u2019t know if this is for real or just angst..? I just want to stop going to school everyday seeing everyone have friends, girlfriends, good looks, making experiences knowing I cant achieve that.

whats her past medical history? and maybe about 40 other questions.  even calling my cat a train wreck. she was in horrible condition and he kept telling me things such as \"well if you wouldve taken her to your regular vet and had checkups sooner, all of this couldve been prevented\" \"you should've given her her medicine. hyperthyroidism is manageable and bc you didnt do this and that your cat is in the condition that shes in\"   which just made me feel so damn guilty. i wanted to take her away right then and there. he then tells me that he couldnt feel her liver and that she only had 25% of her kidneys working and that she was extremely dehydrated.\n\nhe mentioned giving her medicine and iv drips and changing her diet but because of the state she was in, he said it wouldn't do much at all at this point because her kidneys would eventually fail. so then he suggests euthanasia. and my heart dropped like a rock. i didnt want to do it. i wanted to give her the medicine i was hell bent on it. ill pay it now, i dont care what the price is ill pay it now! but he kept pushing me and my sister to sign up for a credit plan to pay for it because he simply \"didnt want to be the bank\" he even said that we could give her all of the medicine and change her diet etc and theres a possibility that it still wont work at all because of how debilitated she was. \n\neventually our family made the decision to have her put to sleep on the same day as the visit. we had a previous cat who passed away due to kidney failure and we didnt want her to go through the same thing. we all snuggled her, kissed her and pet her until she breathed her final breath on the table. it was heart wrenching. we didnt want to bring her home because we all live with out 80 year old grandmother who prior to having her put to sleep, my grandmother would see her dragging her legs and see how weak and exhausted she looked and would start crying and saying how she didnt want to see the cat suffer like that anymore.  we didnt want to bring her home because we didnt want anything to happen to grandma so  we had everything done in one day and it all happened so fast. im still torn about it. i feel like i can go back in time and pull her away from the table, and bring her to present day. \n\ni miss you so much misty,  my little baby. it felt like we all yanked you out of this world too soon and thats what drives me crazy. the regular vet i tookher to long ago when we first found out about it told us all that she had hyperthyroidism. all 3 of us were in charge of making sure she got her medicine until she finished it, and then it dwindled down to just me having the responsibility. i was in a very stressed out mindset between my shit job with no set hours,  and  taking care of my grandmother who has dementia.we have to make sure she dosent wander outside or anything. and had completely forgotten/ was counting on other family members to give her her medicine because i was not home. i had forgotten that she even took  medicine at all because she was doing so well. she was eating, and playing until about last year when i went to have her ears checked. thats when they reminded me. and it all went downhill. \n\nso again i gave her her medicine and she  finished it. only to find out this year she would have to be put to sleep. i never intended to hurt you misty, i never wanted you to get so sick. every morning i cry my eyes out wishing you were here with me on my bed or licking my hand or even meowing that cute little \"hello\" meow you used to do. every day i think about the what ifs and the if onlys. i cant even smell or look at certain things anymore, i cant smile or be happy anymore without my baby. \ni bought a box cutter last week because i was seriously contemplating ending my own life because of the horrible guilt. i feel like i murdered that cat. i feel like i purposefully let her get sick and die . i felt like she didnt need to be euthanized. it was my responsibility to make sure you got your medicine and i fucked up so bad. i dont want to live anymore feeling like this. im so sorry my sweet baby kitty.   how can i help my grandmother if i failed to help you? i feel like im the only one in the world dealing with this situation. i  know im not, but i just want to fucking die. i hate existing. everyday i wake up im reminded that my cat is gone. my best friend, my baby is dead and i caused it and i want to throw up. i hate living i want to die and just not feel anything im so sorry misty im so sorry\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

I was in big crisis in the last two years, life was not what I was expecting to be and things are so complicated, I tried, tried and I am still being fucked by things. So my cousin lives in another country and I asked her if I could stay with her for 3 months until things get better and I can organize myself to live here. So I moved here one month ago and I am trying to build things to live here. Maybe another country, another life maybe things get better, I don't know, I am trying.  \nWhen I asked her if I can stay in her home she was really kind and supportive, it was in august/2019. Then I got here last month and she isn't nice at all. She wakes me up on purpose, she says bad things like \"I can watch my tv cause you are sleeping on the couch\" (the couch is \"my bed\" now). She insinuated that I should find a place for me since the day I arrived here. I try the most to help with things, I clean the house, I wash her clothes, I go the supermarket, I buy the food, I cook the food, I try to be outside the most so I give her a space. And still she's acting bad towards me. I don't know what to do since I asked her to be here for 3 months and after one month things are bad like this. The thing is that I feel so lonely right now and then I tried to talk with her yesterday and she was so mean, she say things like \"people are lonely\", \"grow up that life is hard\", \"cut off this depressed shit\" and others things really mean. The she got out and get really really really drunk with her friends and when she got home, she was another person, she was fun, making jokes, making me laugh, we watch a movie together and I was so fucked up with all the shit that I didn't sleep at all this night. Then she wakes up and starting a argument with me cause the dishes are dirty, but it was her, she used this last night when she was drunk, I tried to talk with her and she just said something like \"I hate that you here\". Now I am really confused. I know that I am not the asshole at all, but will I be the asshole if I kill myself now? I don't wanna kill myself because of her, I just wanna end it all cause I am so full of this shitty life. Will I be the asshole if I kill myself now here, away from my family, without saying goodbye, without people knowing what really happened to me?\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.
