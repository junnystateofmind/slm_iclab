I have an extremely caring an overall amazing boyfriend, and an awesome friend who I basically consider as an older brother.\n\nI have nothing to live for. My mother is verbally abusive, and when I call out for help with the few close friends I have left, she says I'm lying and she'll call me out and ruin my life. Now, I don't even know if I'm lying or not. If I am, just ignore this then. I really don't know anymore. Everyday, I'm so confused. I have no right to be proud of anything, and because I go to a really tough high school, often I don't have the time to practice violin (but I do a lot of competitions and honor orch, etc. so yeah not good) and yanno, college applications are coming up and I don't think I have anything to show. I do homework during class so I can finally relax during lunch, but I tell my mom I do homework during lunch to avoid getting my ass kicked. She compulsively checks my phone and reads my texts (more than I have my phone, her reason is that my parents bought it and not me), goes through my stuff and takes it, then tells me she did nothing of the sort, and yet I'm the crazy horrible reputation ruining liar here. I guess I don't even know if I am?\n\nI'm just so tired of it all. I know that there's things to look forward to and live for, but I feel nothing for it. I've had suicidal thoughts and depression and whatever and my mom is saying I'm lying and making it up. I just don't know what to do, because even though I'm just a teenager, I could probably say my boyfriend is the only person I'd want to spend life with if things work out (I've dated before and so has he). But as of now, I'm giving everyone aneurysms or something dealing with me and getting mad at me. My violin and sports are doing basically nothing because I don't have time or energy and this generation is pretty damn good at this stuff. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I know my boyfriend probably would have a really hard time dealing with the fact that I was gone, for a very long time. I've been debating ending the relationship to make it easier on him.\n\nI'm sorry, I don't know what to ask of y'all. Just please help me. I'm talked out. I just don't know anymore. Everytime someone tries to help everything honestly just gets worse.

(her heart was a 14% functionality due to a silent heart attack 13 days beforehand caused by damage done via medication to keep the cancer away which also caused diabetes and kidney failure).\n\n7 days after she died I was diagnosed with Bowel Cancer and spent that Christmas in hospital having 40% of my bowels removed (I have nodules on my lungs they are keeping an eye on).\n\nBeing in the same hospital as Paola died 6 weeks beforehand plus certain pain medication caused hallucinations and the beginning of my diagnosis of PTSD.\n\nNo family because my mum by this time was in a care home in late stages of early onset dementia.\n\nIt felt like the universe was just hitting me with punch after punch just to see how many times I could stand back up.\n\n6 months on no one visiting so outside contact, I was on suicide watch and Samaritans help line actually called me weekly to see if I was still around, I had a plan to end my life, my logic boiling down to the following two points.\n\nIf I end my life and that is the end then I am in no more pain.\n\nIf I end my life and there is something after I am with Paola.\n\nHad a plan, even down to writing a script that would send out emails to my Doctor and Psychologist so professionals found my body not my neighbors, my dogs had a forever home setup and I was visiting all the forums and communities saying goodbye to all the games me and Wife had played.\n\nI was in a very dark place and the only light was an oncoming train which was either \"cancer comes back\" or \"A life without my best friend)\n\nEverything was black and grey, nothing felt real to me and even when they told me 73% chance my bowel cancer wasn't coming back I couldn't smile and be happy.\n\n**What changed ?**\n\nOne of the last places that I was going to visit was the game The Division, it had many good memories of us both exploring, shooting out windows, messing around, I did a walk through saying goodbye to my wife, and as I logged off an advertisement for The Division 2 came up and I thought to myself, \"lets see what mess they have made\" \"No reason to keep my money if I am going to end things\" So I bought the most expensive pack, downloaded it and logged on.\n\nSomething amazing happened, the next morning I wanted to log back on, I hadn't gamed since Paola had died, I hadn't interacted, talked or blown anything up.\n\nA few days later I wrote a reddit post on that forum thanking the developers for saving my life.\n\nThe response was amazing and people started saying why don't you go on youtube, on twitch, why don't you talk about your experiences, mental health, cancer, diabetes, dialysis, heart disease, why don't you tell the world about how gaming helped you.\n\nMy response was \"what have I got to loose\", I watched my wife die, could anything anyone said about me making a fool of myself online ever come close to this.\n\nI bought a mic, I bought a webcam, I did cooking videos, vlogs, streaming and those victories really helped me go from day to day.\n\nI never missed a day at least 1 video every single day went up on youtube and twitch.\n\nI have close to 500 followers on Youtube, close to 1000 on Twitch, others follow me on Facebook, Reddit and Mixer, I now multi stream to all 4 main places.\n\nAm I still broken yes, I am classed as severely disabled, some days It takes me coming down stairs 3 times for me remembering to brush my teeth or do laundry.\n\nI spend a lot of time in VR Beat Saber, SkyrimVr and others, Valve sent me a Valve index with no strings attached, after reading one of my posts (both me and Paola were involved in VR since 2016 due to her disabilities it was wonderful).\n\nVR is an amazing tool for fighting depression, the complete immersion of being within a game be it a horror, a rhythm game (I have no rhythm), or fantasy, can help switch your mind to a world where life makes more sense.\n\nMy Senior Psychologist and 2 of my specialists have signed off on me all feeling that Gaming, VR and my Vlogging actually have given me a level of existence and a place to be.\n\nI still suffer from depression but this is how I cope, I still need post it notes on my walls to remember changing clothes, washing and shaving.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

I\u2019m constantly trying to make it a point to address to every doctor I\u2019ve been to in the past 8 years that I literally hate being alive and I\u2019ve even been honest as to how many times in a span of a year Ive tried to commit suicide, even up to date. I\u2019ve tried signing myself into our local hospital to try to be admitted to get real help and they\u2019ve only ever kept me for a night each time. Ive begged to stay and I\u2019m still sent home since I seem calm. \n\nI have always acted like I was fine in front of people since I was raised that it was not okay to be depressed or show negative emotions as I had an abusive mother. Because of that, I can\u2019t express sadness normally, instead I just seem calm and most thing I\u2019m being sarcastic or trying to be funny. I don\u2019t openly cry in front of others since I honestly hate people seeing me cry when I\u2019m a support figure for a lot of people I know. \n\n\nI\u2019ve tried making appointments with psychiatrists (we don\u2019t have psychologists at our hospital, they\u2019re hours away and I can\u2019t drive), but they often push Ativan which doesn\u2019t react well with me.

I have always been a sad person, naturally and I suppose this can take a toll on the people around you but it was only the other night that I saw just how much it could. \n\nEvery night my mother stands outside my door and says \u201cGoodnight love you sweet pea\u201d to which I ALWAYS reply. Except this night I had a headache so I forgot about staying up later than my parents so I could check all the doors were locked. Instead at around 9 I went to sleep. About half an hour and a half later when my mum was going to bed I woke to see her standing at my door. I was half asleep so I said \u201cI\u2019m trying to sleep\u201d and she apologised and went to bed\n\nThe next morning I questioned her on why she stood at my door and she said \u201cEvery night I say goodnight and it\u2019s not just to remind you it\u2019s for me to check you\u2019re still alive but last night you didn\u2019t respond and I went to go to bed but I stopped went back an said goodnight through the door again and you didn\u2019t answer so I opened the door and thought oh she\u2019s asleep but then as I walked a way a voice in my head said you were dead so I stood at your door waiting to see you breathe. \n\nThe point is even though I moved on and that I haven\u2019t felt depressed for over a year my mother still does every single day.

Disappointed in everything. \n\nMyself, for being...mediocre. That's the only word that comes to mind when I consider my life. I've been given so many gifts and people that love me, and I waste it all. I don't quite understand what's wrong with me, but I know there's something not clicking right in my brain. People talk about a certain fire behind someone's eyes, a drive that pushes them to work hard for their goals. I dont have that. I'm not passionate about anything. I find myself with no motivation to do anything, even doing days without eating. Some days I'll be how I used to, full of energy and making people laugh, but, as quickly as it appeared, it's gone. I'm back to laying in bed all day, not speaking to anyone, not doing anything that I'm not required to. The only thing that impresses me anymore is how easily I lie to my own family. As soon as they call, I become this other person. The person they want me to be, who does well in school and never had any issues. \n\nI don't feel joy anymore. Not a trace of genuine happiness, other than the aforementioned 'good days'. Even the things that used to make me happiest, like Christmas, now just seem annoying and pointless. I can't sleep, often laying awake for hours on end. \n\nFuck, I miss him. I miss my Da. I would give anything in the world for 5 more minutes with him. He was everything to me, my whole world. I loved him with everything in me. You could come to him in the worst possible situation, and he would tell you what you needed to hear, and you would always come away feeling better. But now he's gone. He left, leaving a mess that my family has yet to fix, and now I'll never see him again. Never hug him, or hear his roaring laughter. I'll never again have him look me in the eyes and say \"I'm proud of you, son.\" And that breaks my heart. Sometimes I go back and listen to old voicemails, just to hear his voice. \n\nI'm disappointed in my family, some more than others. We all came together as a family for the funeral, and not even 24 hours later they're already fighting. I don't understand what I have to do to let them know I need help. I shouldn't be too hard on them, but if my friend who hasn't seen me in 3 years can discern I'm struggling over the phone, surely my own family could tell. I told them I wasn't ready to go back, that I couldn't handle it, but they didn't listen. I've never once in my life had real freedom. Freedom to choose what I want. Thats not exactly true. Theres 2 options: do what they want, or be on my own. \n\nDisappointed in those around me. Now, I could never blame anyone here for my problems, but damn if they can't tell. There are people here who's job it is to identify people who are struggling. They haven't approached me, nor have any of my 'friends' here. I went to the counselor once, and after an hour of talking, he told me that he thought my Das death might have had an impact on me. No shit. Say what you will about my high school, but I'm more comfortable telling anyone there that I'm struggling than I ever would be here. \n\nI don't know where something went wrong, where I lost my drive, but I want to fix it. I want to be happy again, but every day that seems farther away. Every day, I feel less like myself and I just want it to end.\nAs a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** \n\n###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###\n\nWe're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  \n\nBut there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. \n\nAnything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. \n\nDo not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  \n\nIn [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. \n\n**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something \"innocent\" like \"I hope you find peace\", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  \n\n###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###\n\nKeep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  \n\n* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular \"good\" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that \"it's not so bad\", and this is usually experienced as \"I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try\".  People who've had \"help\" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   \n\n*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. \n\n* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the \"it gets better\" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. \n\n* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.\n\nTo avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.\n\n###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###\n\nOften comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  \n\nThey will typically try to scratch their psychological \"itch\" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:\n\n* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than \"brutally forcing someone to stay alive\" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.\n\n* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of \"solidarity\" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  \n\nMany suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: \n\n* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (\"Don't do it!\"), cheerleading (\"You've got this!\") or meaningless false promises (\"Trust me, it gets better!\"), or invalidation (\"Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!\").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)\n\n* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  \n\nPlease [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours.

Usually this passes but this is the longest stretch I\u2019ve had. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019ve come to some sort of acceptance that this is how I\u2019m going to feel forever if I don\u2019t end it.\n\nThe current climate of the world (I don\u2019t mean Global Warming) has also pushed me the closest I\u2019ve ever been to ending it.

If would be great if you could direct me to the right subreddit.\n\nEnglish is not my first language so please bear with me.\n\n**TL:DR**\nI have done a lot of reading when I procrastinate from work. I want to start a daily journal on reddit to keep track of my positives and negatives, my progress, and hopefully get advices on when I go wrong. \nI noticed that I get overtly stressed over tiny chores/work/things to do, and I'd like to tackle it via progressive increase in exposure and desensitization. Then incorporate other CBT techniques.\n\n***Story/Background:***\n\nI have only recently been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder after a close friend forced me to. Looking back now, I think I first had mild depression around 16yo.\nI recall having a general apathy towards life, results, ambition, family, and friends. Any motivation is fleeting and I'd spend most of my days daydreaming. Perhaps hoping for some catastrophe in the school so that I'm no longer bored.\nThe depression seemingly subsided - at least I think so - as I continued on aimlessly on some path my family/culture/friends expected of me. while I'm not excelling, I'm not underperforming. I have close group of friends and we enjoy movies and outings.\nIt all went to hell when I was around 22/23yo. I should add that I have Contamination OCD and during my University days, decided against my better judgement that I should live with a close friend.\nThis proved horrible as my OCD meant I couldn't live normally or telerate their habits. I thought I had it in control and hid my oddities well. I didn't. \n\nMy housemates at the time hated me and talked loads behind my back. All the while I was oblivious about their hatred towards me while they acted normal around me. I noticed somewhere around 3 months in. I had the chance to look through their messages and curiousity started my depression.\nReading through all those hate filled complaints and messages was painful. Having to sleep in the same room as him after was impossivle. To act civil while I moved out was tough. While we did not have a big fight because we both hated confrontation,\nour 6year friendship fell apart; along with it, I resolutely cut ties with the entire group of friends that was associated with this guy. \n\nI believe this to be the \"event\" which kickstarted my depression. Worse still, I moved to a different place and had another falling out with another group of housemates. We started off great, even went on a trip together. In about two months, I don't recall the cause of it. But I remember they confronted me on something and I just started withdrawing from them. \nAfter that, I stopped going to lectures and classes. I was fired from my club because I couldn't perform anymore. (I spent the first year making it into the committee), As a result, I graduated with a subpar GPA. I've never felt worse. I feel like I disaappointed my dad, wasted his money, and failed to prove myself to those who looked down on me.\nI spent the next two years isolating myself in my room, only going out for groceries if I absolutely have to. I avoided the housemates by being active at odd hours. I lied to my family that I was trying and failing to apply for jobs while the truth is I mindlessly watched seasons after seasons of brainless TV. \nI am eternally thankful that my dad supported me through this lie. He paid for my rent, food, and courses I took because I wanted to extend my visa. Oh, I was also an international student so you can imagine how much money that costed. \nI cannot begin to describe the amount of guilt I feel. \n\nThe reason I'm even trying to get better is because of guilt. My main motivation is to make them proud of me.\n\nWhen I was 27, I spent a year dodging their concerned calls. They were so worried they sent a friend over to check on me. And finally, they took a flight over themselves. My visa finally expired and I went home.\nAfter getting home, I once again lied to them about job searching and spent a year doing my best to avoid family events and outings. Finally, last year they forcefully got me a job with my relatives and I've feel into a routine since then.\nI majored in Finance and Accounting in Uni. But my results were subpar and it has been 3-4years at this point. I barely remember a thing and I can't perform. I can't even get myself to pick the knowledge back up. \nAdmittedly though, the work I perform doesn't require that much. But alas, I fail to perform. I find it difficult to get myself to issue a simple invoice which takes 5muinutes tops. \n\nI am more and more disappointed in myself over time. I hate the job, but I haven't even sent out a single resume. The very thought of going for interviews and exposing myself as incompetent frightens me. GEtting judged by anonymous HR people makes me hate myself.\nI contemplated all kinds of alternatives ie: getting a remote part time job so that I can make extra income while improving myself. Taking courses online and hopefully put me ahead of others.\nUltimately though, I have not brought myself to do any of those things. Even this reddit post took 5days of contemplating before I could do it.\n\nI know what I should do, and people will say \"you never know if you never try\" but I can't help but imagine the negatives. Posting for help on reddit for example opens me up to judgement from random strangers, trolls, even scams, some of them incredibly damaging. \nImproving myself via courses/books/lectures can be an enormous time sink. Not to mention that what is learned may not even be useful to me in the future and may end up being a waste of time.\nCurrently, I spend the measly 4 hours of free time I get after getting back from work watching movies or reading novels. They're not entertaining nor boring, but they keep me sane. I dread the day that they are taken away. \n\n\n***Analysis:***\n\nGrowing up, I've been instilled with the idea that I am smart, but lazy. I believe this became a part of my core identify. I'm 29 and I don't recall ever working hard, for anything. \nI've coasted through life however, largely because my parents made me go to numerous additional tuitions, cram classes, etc. I've never done homework, mostly copied them off of friends, but have the concept repeated to you enough times and it gets carved into memory.\nMy results up till 15yo were always above average. \n\nI believe due to the circumstances, I grew up without developing any self-discipline skills. Never having an aim or goal and simply going through the motions meant I was lost the moment those guidance were taken away. Believing myself to be smart also creates a subconcious anxiety - what if I worked hard but still failed? that would mean I'm not smart.\n\nThroughout life, I have had a panic attack twice. Once when I was 10. An art project which took me 20minutes tops was criticised and I broke down in tears and hyperventilated, having to be taken home from school.\nThe next was when I was 16. Around this time, I was getting progessively more apathetic at school. I struggled to get up in the morning and was often late to school. I was late for 10 times and my parents were called to school which resulted in me hyperventilating once again.\nI also spent a lot of time gaming which I believe was some sort of coping mechanism similar to mindlessly watching youtube or browsing reddit. \n\nNot entirely sure what these events mean. But I think I can conclude that I have an inability to accept criticism or face consequences of my own actions. \n\n***What I want to do:***\n\nAs stated above, I want to tackle my self-disclipline, responsibility avoidance, and anxiety towards work, via progressively increasing exposure. \nI will practice mindful relaxation and attempt to associate the relaxation with the trigger(work).\nI will also journal on reddit. 1. To have accountability, 2. to further dissect my thoughts, analyze the issues, solve them. and 3. to get advice.    \n\n\nThank you for reading this far. Or if you skipped, thanks anyways for your time. I may have left out some details or major events in life, I'm not entirely sure and I'm too tired to go back and check.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

I usually stay calm and let her get it out of her system but today I snapped and told her that I\u2019m suicidal, hoping that she\u2019d calm down. She did not. She belittled me for it while I tried to keep myself from crying too much. I tried again, telling her that I want to kill myself and asking if that\u2019s what she wants. Her immediate response was \u201cYou know what? Do what you fucking want.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m so tired. I\u2019m sixteen, this isn\u2019t normal. I defend her at every turn, even now in group chats with friends calling her abusive while I\u2019m sleeping over at a friend\u2019s house because the thought of returning home makes me feel like I\u2019m gonna puke. \nI had a vivid image of my dead body covered in blood with a note saying that line of hers and a smiley face. I also want to see the look on her face when I walk up to her with a knife in my hand and tear my wrists open. I want to damage her as much as she\u2019s damaged me. \n\nI\u2019m not as depressed as I normally am, surprisingly. Just tired. She came by with a bag of extra clothes for me and I think she found an empty pack of cigarettes in my closet because she took a shirt of mine that was under it (I hide it between layers). My friend went out to get it for me because thinking about talking to her face to face made me anxious. She blamed him, to his face, for me wanting to switch schools; that he scared me out of my current program. \n\nI\u2019m not actually going to kill myself or anything, as much as I want to. It\u2019s too short notice for me to make any final preparations. But I think if I hadn\u2019t called my friend I\u2019d have broken my self harm clean streak and cut down to the dermis again or maybe even deeper. \n\nThe icing on the cake for all this is that I got called selfish by my mom for not coming home. Her boyfriend\u2019s mother passed away recently (we live with him) and her funeral is tomorrow. I have selfish timing apparently, and I\u2019m not even the one who started this whole thing in the first place. I\u2019ve cried so much that I don\u2019t feel any strong emotions anymore. All I have right now is sadness, but it almost fades into me being tired. \n\nI also have guilt. Not because of this but because I have an important group project due tomorrow and I was supposed to make a poster. I obviously wasn\u2019t able to complete it. People\u2019s grades are going to suffer because I\u2019m too weak to just walk inside the appartment and sit through some yelling     \n\nI just don\u2019t deserve to live, I guess. I\u2019m a massive letdown to everyone in one way or another. People would be much happier with me gone, my parents are divorced and though my dad would be upset about losing me at least he won\u2019t have to put up with my melodrama anymore. My mom won\u2019t have to stress herself out over me being too tired to put effort into school, there wouldn\u2019t be any strain on her relationship with her boyfriend anymore because of me. My classmates won\u2019t have to worry about bad grades because of a flakey group member. My boyfriend can get someone who won\u2019t ruin his mood all the time just by talking about their feelings. My family doesn\u2019t have to worry about me being a disgrace or anything, if a member dies by suicide they\u2019ll likely just get pity rather than dirty looks after I inevitably become a junkie. \n\nThe only one I would really feel bad for is my dog. I don\u2019t see him often, every few months or so. But he loves me about as much as I love him. I don\u2019t know how I could ever explain to him, in a way that he\u2019ll understand, why I\u2019m leaving and not coming back. Why it\u2019s not his fault, the extent of how much I love him, how good of a boy he is. That\u2019s just something I\u2019ll never be able to do for him. \n\nVent over. I need to get some sleep but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to get up in the morning. \n\nIf it\u2019s any consolation, to those that have read this far, I\u2019m seeing my psychologist tomorrow.\nAs a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

She is the only person who has ever helped me not be depressed. After being depressed and okay-ish at my best for about a decade, talking to her made me feel happy. And it wasn't just for a minute, an hour, or a day. I felt happy for about half a year. \n\nThat was what led me to tell her. I wanted to thank her, and I couldn't say thank you without telling her why. When I told her about my mental health, she was supportive. Even though I haven't felt happy in about five months, I still look forward to talking to her.\n\nBut today I did something stupid. I started an argument over something that so trivial that one noticed it. Usually when I am speaking to anyone, I try to think about what I say before I say it, because I would hate to say anything that bothers people, but not today. Today, I when I was with her, I didn't once stop to think about what I was saying. If it came to mind, I said it. \n\nI didn't think she was bothered until she told tried to tell me something like \"I spend my whole life making sure I don't... Isn't it ironic that that I end up doing that?\" As she said that, I saw her face get red and ber eyes start to tear up a little. And I realized that I was being a fucking asshole. \n\nShe has never asked me to do anything. Not a single time. She has helped me when I am having suicidal thought. She has helped me when I feel like I am about to have a mental breakdown. She has helped me through a lot. And I just go and return the favor by being the worst person to her.\n\nI have been trying to distance myself from her, because in the past couple of months, life just hasn't felt like its for me. I don't think that I should ever feel better. Depression is exactly what I deserve. Everytime I have caught myself feeling a little better, I just tell myself what I have to feel like shit again. Now, I will find it easier to no longer talk to her. As much as I looked forward to talking to her, I look forward to her forgetting me.\n\nThere isn't a whole lot keeping me from having the thought that makes me take my last, she is one of the two things that even just thinking of her helps me keep the suicidal thoughts just thoughts. I think she still wants to talk, and I know I will see her for at least the next 2 months, but when those 2 months are up. I won't talk to her, and I will do everything that I can to keep me from ever talking to her again. I don't want to make her sad or ever make her cry again.\n\nRight now, I know I probably won't gather up the courage to end it, because I still have to see her. But I did resently take up self harm. I started by hitting my upper thigh, so no one would see the marks. Recently, I started growing out my hair, so that no one will notice that I started hitting my head. A while after I see her for my last time, the odds that I'll finally do it will rise.\n\nI fucking hate that I possibly made someone feel anywhere near how if feel most of the time. I hate myself even more for doing it to the only person I have ever felt safe enough to tell everything about anything.\nIf you were a psychologist, read this post and answer the following question.

I quit my job 3 months ago because of the stress and anxiety it was putting me through. Of late my mental health has worsened a lot and I can't seem to get out of the loop. Everything makes me cry and I don't even feel like going out of my room most days. I go to a psychiatrist and I am on meds but nothing seems to be working. (Ive changed almost 7 therapists/psychiatrists now because my mental health was showing no improvement.) I feel like a parasite, latching on to my mother and aunts for financial support. I want to move out and live independently but I don't even feel anything. I don't feel like doing anything, let alone wanting to work. I constantly worry whether I'm just being lazy and making excuses or whether I genuinely have a problem. I don't want to face people, give interviews or work among other people. Everytime I get a job I end up having panic attacks and excessively stressing out. The thought of having responsibility and knowing that there are certain expectations I have to meet while working, and the constant anxiety of doing badly at my job trouble me so much. I don't want to go through any of this. I don't want to. I don't want to do anything. I'm tired of being taunted by everyone and having to dodge questions about why I'm still unemployed.

First of all, forgive my English as it is not my first language (Im from Spain).\n\nIm a 26 yo civil engineering, graduated in 2018 after 5 long years of hard study. Before this, I did a couple internships in civil engineering during college. The second one went pretty good and my boss actually wanted to hire me but I decided to leave to start the masters. After finishing it one year later and not finding any job, I ended up in an energy company, in the sales department, a field totally different than my educational background, where I stayed temporarily until I could find something in my field. The thing is, several months have passed and Im still here but also I found out I dont like this job, to the point that it has driven to a state of depression and unhappiness, but still here because of the money. The situation has been aggravated since I cant find anything else, resulting in a feel of no motivation to find other jobs and challenge myself to reach higher in life. Also, I feel that Im not as competent as I should be and that makes me feel bad too. Times is passing and Im still stuck in this conundrum with the pressure of no succeeding. I know this relies in the survival of the fittest and work hard concept but it seems to be more difficult for me. The only times I feel an extra shoot of happiness is when I practice sports or Im with my girlfriend/friends.

Their mimicked voice echoes.   \nTriggering the avalanche of spiteful words spraying from your pale lips.   \n*They hate you*.

You watch them cry for help and ask for you to stop and listen to yourself, listening to you hate yourself and want to die is too much for them.  \nThen you watch them leave. You watch them run away in fear.   \n\nYour bony fingers crack as they clench into a fist. Your jagged nails are digging into your skin.   \nAnger engulfs your vision, taking control of rationality.  \nThe first blow strikes hard on your face. It stings, but you go a second time.

Tears are finally pushing out, causing more pain than the blade that now pierces your skin. Scarred and thin, the skin breaks. But no satisfaction is found unless you cut too deep. Only disappointment seeps in, blaming yourself for your cowardly slashes. Not going deep enough, pathetic little scratches. Why can't you feel more pain? Why can't you cut deeper?   \n*You fail at even the simplest things*.  \nYou cut more. Faster, harder.

Whenever this happens she says \u201coh I should have thought of that\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so stupid\u201d \u201cI should have known\u201d and it makes me feel as if she is expecting me to remind her of these things. I appreciate all the things she does but if it\u2019s something she organizes for example shopping like I have no control over what she forgets to bring but she somehow makes me feel responsible, or at least I do somehow. \n\nI just can\u2019t understand this negative side to her and it seems like somethings always wrong and if it is she exacerbates it, I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s from her depression if she has low self esteem and is hard on herself if she makes mistakes or makes mistakes on purpose, regardless it affects me.\n\nI know not everything here was directly about depression but I thought because it relates to my situation might as well say what\u2019s on my mind.\nDoes anyone else have perspective on having depressions and living with parents?
